00:00:15 [Kailash Nath - CTO]: Good morning, Rahul. I'm doing well, thank you. I'm eager to dive into the details of how Juspay Hypercheckout can benefit our e-commerce platform.

00:00:30 [Rahul Kothari]: Fantastic. I understand that improving your checkout experience and reducing transaction failures are key challenges for your business. Juspay Hypercheckout excels in addressing these pain points with its seamless integration and robust features. Let's start by delving into the technical aspects. 

00:00:50 [Kailash Nath]: Absolutely, Rahul. I'm particularly interested in how easily we can integrate Hypercheckout into our existing systems and the security measures in place to protect our customer data. Can you elaborate on that?

00:01:05 [Rahul Kothari]: Of course, Kailash. Juspay Hypercheckout offers multiple integration methods, supporting platforms like Android, iOS, Web, and cross-platform tools such as Flutter and React Native. The solution ensures PCI DSS compliance and follows RBI guidelines with features like Card-on-File Tokenization and mobile number-based OTP authentication for enhanced security.

00:01:30 [Kailash Nath]: That sounds reassuring, Rahul. I appreciate the emphasis on security. How about scalability and performance? We need a solution that can handle our growing transaction volume without compromising speed and reliability.

00:01:50 [Rahul Kothari]: Absolutely, Kailash. Hypercheckout's dynamic routing algorithms ensure high transaction success rates by monitoring payment failures and making real-time routing decisions. It also supports Over-the-Air Updates, enabling real-time configuration changes without affecting the native app capabilities, ensuring scalability and performance optimization.

00:02:15 [Kailash Nath]: That's impressive, Rahul. Now, let's discuss pricing. Could you provide more details on the pricing model for startups and how it aligns with our business requirements?

00:02:30 [Rahul Kothari]: Certainly, Kailash. For startups, our pricing model includes a transaction fee of 0.35% per transaction and a subscription fee of ₹20,000 per month. We also offer a discounted option of 0.25% per transaction or ₹15,000 per month, whichever is higher. This flexible pricing structure aims to support businesses like yours while ensuring cost-effectiveness.

00:02:55 [Kailash Nath]: Thank you for clarifying that, Rahul. I can see the value proposition in the pricing model. One concern I have is regarding ongoing maintenance and support. How does Juspay ensure that our integration remains smooth and updated?

00:03:15 [Rahul Kothari]: That's a valid concern, Kailash. Juspay provides dedicated support and regular updates to ensure that your integration remains seamless. Our team is committed to assisting you with any technical issues and implementing new features to enhance your payment experience continuously.
