00:02:15 Kailash Nath (CTO, E-commerce): Good morning, Rahul. I appreciate you reaching out. I'm interested in learning more about how Hypercheckout can integrate seamlessly with our platform and enhance our payment processing capabilities.

00:04:30 Rahul Kothari: Absolutely, Kailash. Our Hypercheckout SDK is designed to be a future-proof payments toolkit that offers early access to cutting-edge payment innovations without significant tech investment. It simplifies payment flows, supports various payment methods, and improves user experience, ultimately boosting conversion rates and reducing operational hassles.

00:09:20 Rahul Kothari: I completely understand your concerns, Kailash. Security is paramount to us, and the Hypercheckout SDK is built with robust security features to ensure safe transactions. As for integration costs, our pricing model for startups is either 0.35% per transaction or â‚¹20,000 per month, whichever is higher. This pricing structure aims to offer flexibility for startups like yours.

00:12:10 Kailash Nath: Thank you for clarifying, Rahul. The security measures and pricing structure are assuring. I appreciate the transparency in pricing. I'd like to explore further how Hypercheckout can align with our platform's needs. Could we discuss scheduling a product demo to see the integration in action?
