00:00:00 Srijan Amrit: Hi Priyanka, thanks for taking the time today. Let's discuss how we can improve your hr management solutions.

00:00:05 Priyanka Gupta: Hi Srijan, sure I’m excited to learn more about your offerings.

00:0:10 Srijan Amrit: Priyanka, I understand you're looking to enhance your checkout experience and tackle transaction failures. I’d like to introduce HyperCheckout, which not only focuses on a seamless payment experience but also integrates quickly with your existing system. 

00:0:25 Priyanka Gupta: That sounds interesting, Srijan. Can you tell me more about how HyperCheckout integrates with our current infrastructure? 

00:0:35 Srijan Amrit: Absolutely! HyperCheckout is designed for fast integration. We provide detailed APIs that can easily connect to your existing e-commerce platform. Whether you’re using Shopify, Magento, or any custom-built website, we have the library and documentation to fast-track integration. 

00:0:54 Priyanka Gupta: That's good to know. How about the security measures? E-commerce is very sensitive to data breaches. 

00:1:02 Srijan Amrit: Security is our top priority. HyperCheckout employs industry-leading encryption protocols, including TLS 1.2 and PCI DSS compliance to safeguard transactions. Your users’ data is transmitted securely and is never stored without encryption. We also implement tokenization for payment details, which adds another layer of protection.

00:1:26 Priyanka Gupta: Tokenization is reassuring. But if we switch to HyperCheckout, what impact would that have on transaction failures?

00:1:32 Srijan Amrit: Great question! Our solution includes robust error handling and retry mechanisms that detect transaction failures in real-time. This means that your customers can resume their payment process seamlessly without starting from scratch. We’ve seen a significant decrease in cart abandonment due to this feature.

00:1:54 Priyanka Gupta: That sounds promising! But what about support after the integration? 

00:2:00 Srijan Amrit: We pride ourselves on a high-touch support model. Post-integration, our dedicated support team is available 24/7. Additionally, we offer resources like documentation, FAQs, and personalized troubleshooting sessions, ensuring that your team can effectively manage any queries that might arise.

00:2:24 Priyanka Gupta: I appreciate that level of support. Speaking of support, what about ongoing maintenance costs? 

00:2:29 Srijan Amrit: There are no hidden maintenance fees with HyperCheckout. We work on a transaction-based pricing model at 0.35% per transaction. So your costs scale directly with your transaction volume, allowing you to budget effectively. 

00:2:50 Priyanka Gupta: That’s helpful, but how does the pricing compare to the Express Checkout SDK? 

00:2:56 Srijan Amrit: Excellent question! The Express Checkout SDK is slightly lower in transaction fees at 0.30%. It’s ideal if you have development resources available and are looking to create a fully customized payment interface that matches your brand. Both solutions offer similar security features, but the SDK gives you more flexibility if you choose to build your checkout experience from the ground up.

00:3:26 Priyanka Gupta: I see. So, with the SDK, it will require more development effort on our part. What does that development process look like?

00:3:34 Srijan Amrit: Correct. Integrating the Express Checkout SDK would involve setting it up within your app's development environment. We offer extensive developer documentation, plus sample code snippets to get started. Our API can handle payment confirmations and updates to your database efficiently, ensuring a smooth experience for your customers.

00:3:56 Priyanka Gupta: That makes sense. You mentioned earlier about multiple payment methods. Can you elaborate on what types of payments HyperCheckout supports?

00:4:02 Srijan Amrit: Definitely! HyperCheckout supports a wide range of payment methods, including UPI, credit/debit cards, net banking, and digital wallets such as Paytm and PhonePe. This allows your customers to choose a payment method that they’re comfortable with, which tends to positively impact conversion rates.

00:4:23 Priyanka Gupta: What about transaction volume? If we experience spikes in traffic, will HyperCheckout handle that smoothly? 

00:4:29 Srijan Amrit: Yes! Our architecture is built to scale. We use cloud infrastructure to accommodate varying transaction loads without latency issues. Load balancing and a microservices architecture ensure that as your volume increases, you won’t experience downtime or slowed commit times, which can be critical during peak sales events.

00:4:58 Priyanka Gupta: That’s good to hear. What if we face any issues during peak times? 

00:5:03 Srijan Amrit: In such cases, our monitoring solutions alert our tech team in real-time. We have an incident response strategy in place to tackle and resolve any spikes in transaction failures promptly. This ensures the least disruption for your customers.

00:5:20 Priyanka Gupta: I’m liking what I’m hearing. Can you clarify if there's customizability in the user interface? 

00:5:25 Srijan Amrit: Absolutely! HyperCheckout allows for branding customization where you can modify colors, logos, and even the overall layout to align with your website’s design. For the Express Checkout SDK, you have full control, enabling you to create an entirely bespoke experience from the ground up.

00:5:48 Priyanka Gupta: Customizability is very crucial for us. We want users to feel they’re in a familiar environment while checking out. 

00:5:54 Srijan Amrit: That's a smart approach. The more your checkout feels like part of your web app, the better the conversion rates. Both HyperCheckout and the SDK can enhance user trust and familiarity, thereby reducing cart abandonment rates. 

00:6:10 Priyanka Gupta: That’s insightful. How about handling refunds? Is there a smooth process in place? 

00:6:15 Srijan Amrit: Yes, with both solutions, we provide automated workflows for processing refunds. The system captures transaction details seamlessly, ensuring that refunds are processed quickly, which can significantly enhance customer satisfaction. You’ll receive notifications and reports to keep you updated on the status of refunds.

00:6:37 Priyanka Gupta: That's reassuring. What resources or tools do you provide to analyze our transaction data?

00:6:43 Srijan Amrit: Each integration comes with an analytics dashboard. This dashboard offers insights into transaction volumes, failure rates, user interaction, and more. You can drill down into specific metrics like peak transaction times, preferred payment methods, and refunds, helping you strategize for better performance.

00:7:12 Priyanka Gupta: Wow, that’s a comprehensive approach! What’s the next step if I decide to move forward?

00:7:18 Srijan Amrit: If you’re interested, we’d set up a demo to showcase both HyperCheckout and the Express Checkout SDK, tailored to your specific business needs. Additionally, we can discuss onboarding timelines and next steps for integration.

00:7:36 Priyanka Gupta: That sounds great! I’d love to see how both options would function in real-time. 

00:7:42 Srijan Amrit: Perfect! I’ll arrange for our technical team to present the demo within the next few days. I’ll also share the documentation and case studies with you, so you can see how other e-commerce businesses are benefiting from our solutions.

00:8:00 Priyanka Gupta: Excellent, I look forward to it. Thank you so much, Srijan! 

00:8:06 Srijan Amrit: My pleasure, Priyanka! We’re excited to partner with you and enhance your checkout solution. I'll follow up with an email to finalize the schedule. 

00:8:15 Priyanka Gupta: Perfect, thanks again!

00:8:17 Srijan Amrit: Have a great day!
00:05:10 Srijan Amrit: I understand that your team is looking to enhance the checkout experience while minimizing transaction failures. Our Express Checkout API can be a significant asset in this regard. It’s designed to integrate seamlessly with both mobile apps and websites using our REST APIs. 

00:05:30 Priyanka Gupta: That sounds promising. Can you elaborate on the integration process? Our developers are looking for a straightforward implementation to ensure a smooth transition.

00:05:42 Srijan Amrit: Absolutely. The integration is quite straightforward. We provide detailed documentation, along with SDKs for popular programming languages, which your developers can utilize to set up the payment system easily. Also, during the initial stages, we have a dedicated technical support team that can assist your developers with any questions they may have. 

00:06:10 Priyanka Gupta: That’s reassuring to hear. One of our main concerns is about transaction failures. What mechanisms do you have in place to minimize those? 

00:06:22 Srijan Amrit: Great question! Our solution is equipped with robust error handling and retry logic. If a payment fails, we automatically initiate a retry sequence with smart back-off strategies. Additionally, we track the payment journey closely—giving insights into where the failure might have occurred—so we can address any underlying issues quickly. 

00:06:48 Priyanka Gupta: Nice, that should definitely help improve our conversion rates. However, we also deal with sensitive customer information. How do you ensure data security throughout the payment process?

00:07:05 Srijan Amrit: Security is one of our top priorities. Our Express Checkout API complies with the latest PCI DSS standards. We employ tokenization to ensure sensitive data is encrypted during transactions, which minimizes exposure to any potential breaches. Also, all API communications are conducted over HTTPS to maintain a secure channel.

00:07:32 Priyanka Gupta: That sounds solid. Regarding pricing, you mentioned a fee of 0.25% per transaction. Can you break down if there are any hidden costs involved?

00:07:42 Srijan Amrit: Certainly! The 0.25% fee is the only transaction cost you'll incur. There are no hidden fees or additional charges for the integration or use of the service. Any ongoing costs you should anticipate would arise from maintaining the API and occasional updates, but we are committed to providing this support at no extra cost for our customers.

00:08:08 Priyanka Gupta: That’s good to know. Our sales have been growing rapidly, so scalability is another concern for us. How does the Express Checkout API handle increased transaction volumes?

00:08:21 Srijan Amrit: The API is built on a microservices architecture, which allows it to scale horizontally with demand. If your traffic spikes, the service will automatically allocate more resources to handle the increased load, ensuring that your checkout process remains smooth and uninterrupted. 

00:08:42 Priyanka Gupta: That’s encouraging! My team has mentioned they might need to integrate with multiple payment methods. Does your API support a wide range of payment options?

00:08:57 Srijan Amrit: Yes, it does. The Express Checkout API supports all major payment methods, including credit and debit cards, e-wallets, and local payment options. This flexibility will enable you to cater to a diverse customer base, ensuring everyone can checkout using their preferred method. 

00:09:24 Priyanka Gupta: That's perfect! However, I’d like to know about implementation timelines. How long do you think it would take for us to get started and complete the integration?

00:09:38 Srijan Amrit: Typically, our clients can go live within two to three weeks, provided they allocate the necessary resources on their end for integration. We also offer a sandbox environment where your team can test the API without impacting the live system, which is crucial for a smooth rollout.

00:09:59 Priyanka Gupta: That’s definitely reasonable. Are there additional support services such as training for our team, especially for first-time users?

00:10:11 Srijan Amrit: Yes, we offer comprehensive onboarding assistance that includes training sessions tailored for your team. This ensures they are comfortable with using the API and can proactively manage transactions. Additionally, our support team is always available for ongoing inquiries.

00:10:35 Priyanka Gupta: Excellent! If everything goes well with the integration, what does the long-term support look like? Do you provide regular updates and maintenance?

00:10:46 Srijan Amrit: Absolutely! We believe in continuous improvement. Our engineering team regularly works on enhancing the API, and we roll out updates to all clients without any additional charges. Also, we monitor performance metrics to proactively reach out if we identify potential issues.

00:11:11 Priyanka Gupta: That’s reassuring. Can you also tell me about your existing client base? Do you have clients in the e-commerce industry that are using your Express Checkout API?

00:11:22 Srijan Amrit: Yes, we work with several prominent e-commerce platforms across different segments. Clients have reported a significant drop in cart abandonment rates and improved overall customer satisfaction after implementing our solution. Would you be interested in hearing some case studies?

00:11:42 Priyanka Gupta: Yes, please! That would provide some great context on how your API performs in real-world scenarios.

00:11:50 Srijan Amrit: Sure! One major client was able to reduce their cart abandonment rate by nearly 20% within three months of integrating our API. They particularly appreciated our near-instantaneous payment completions and their ability to customize the checkout experience. Now their checkout flow is much smoother and aligned with their branding. 

00:12:20 Priyanka Gupta: That's impressive! We're keen on customization as well. Can I ask if we can tweak UI elements in the API response to better fit our brand identity?

00:12:34 Srijan Amrit: Absolutely! We provide extensive customization capabilities, allowing you to modify the look and feel of the elements to align them with your branding. This can help create a unified experience across your platform, further enhancing customer trust.

00:12:54 Priyanka Gupta: Awesome! I see a lot of potential here. Is there an easy way to migrate from our current system, should we decide to go ahead with your API?

00:13:06 Srijan Amrit: Definitely! We have a dedicated migration team that works closely with our clients during this process. They assist in data transfer and provide guidance to ensure your existing transactions and customer data flow into our system without interruption.

00:13:28 Priyanka Gupta: That sounds like a safety net! One last thing—what’s your policy on contract terms and commitments?

00:13:40 Srijan Amrit: Our contracts are designed to be flexible. We offer month-to-month agreements, allowing you to scale your usage based on your needs. There's no long-term lock-in so you can test our solution without major commitments.

00:14:04 Priyanka Gupta: Flexibility is key for us. I appreciate you addressing all my questions today. Can we schedule a follow-up to discuss this further with the rest of my team?

00:14:16 Srijan Amrit: Absolutely! I can set up another meeting at your convenience, perhaps after you’ve had time to review our documentation. Would early next week work for your team?

00:14:27 Priyanka Gupta: Yes, that should be good. Let’s tentatively put something on the calendar for next Monday.

00:14:34 Srijan Amrit: Sounds great! I’ll send you a calendar invite and prepare any additional materials you might need for your team’s assessment.

00:14:44 Priyanka Gupta: Thank you, Srijan. You’ve provided valuable insights. Excited to see where this goes!

00:14:52 Srijan Amrit: Likewise, Priyanka! I look forward to talking with your team next week. Have a great day!

00:15:00 [Call Ends]
```
00:10:10 Srijan Amrit: I appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today, Priyanka. I understand that you're interested in improving your e-commerce checkout experience and reducing transaction failures. I believe our products like HyperCredit and Payment Forms can be significant assets for your business.

00:10:30 Priyanka Gupta: Yes, we’ve been facing challenges at the checkout stage, particularly with customers dropping off due to complicated loan application processes. I’m particularly keen to understand how HyperCredit streamlines that.

00:10:50 Srijan Amrit: Absolutely. HyperCredit is designed specifically for seamless lender orchestration. It handles the entire loan lifecycle, which means from application through to disbursement—the customer experience is simplified. Once integrated, customers can apply for financing right at the checkout without needing to redirect to another site.

00:11:10 Priyanka Gupta: That sounds beneficial. However, how does the integration process work with our current systems? Our platform is built on multiple existing technologies.

00:11:30 Srijan Amrit: Great question! HyperCredit is built with a RESTful API architecture, allowing easy integration with virtually any existing system. What we do is provide guidelines and support documentation that outline endpoints for transaction processing, as well as webhook notifications for event tracking. Our team can also assist throughout the implementation process, ensuring smooth integration with your tech stack.

00:11:50 Priyanka Gupta: That’s reassuring to hear. But what about the security aspects? We handle sensitive customer data, and security must be top-tier.

00:12:10 Srijan Amrit: I completely understand your concern. We prioritize data security. HyperCredit employs end-to-end encryption for all data in transit and at rest, alongside compliance to industry standards such as PCI-DSS. Moreover, our service adopts tokenization techniques to further protect sensitive information through our authentication processes. 

00:12:30 Priyanka Gupta: Good to know! Now regarding pricing, I see it’s 0.40% per loan transaction. Can you give me a breakdown of that in terms of total costs, especially since we are looking at gearing ourselves for high sales volume?

00:12:50 Srijan Amrit: Certainly! The 0.40% fee is charged per loan transaction, so it directly scales with your sales volume. For example, if you process $100,000 in loan transactions, your fee would be $400. It's designed to be cost-effective, especially for high-volume merchants like yourself. There are no hidden fees, and we also provide a transparent reporting dashboard to track all fees and transactions.

00:13:15 Priyanka Gupta: That makes sense. What about ongoing support and maintenance? We're very proactive in ensuring our system runs smoothly without any downtime.

00:13:30 Srijan Amrit: We have a dedicated support team available 24/7 for any technical inquiries or issues. Beyond that, we conduct regular system health checks and updates to ensure everything operates meticulously. We also offer a maintenance service that includes periodic optimization recommendations based on your transaction trends.

00:13:50 Priyanka Gupta: Sounds promising! Now, shifting focus a bit, how could the Payment Forms feature also fit into our overall strategy? 

00:14:10 Srijan Amrit: Payment Forms can complement your operations by allowing you to collect payments or promote specific products or services without needing a dedicated website. It’s lightweight and perfect for events or pop-ups. This can help capture customers at physical locations or during promotional events, driving additional revenue streams without extensive technical requirements.

00:14:50 Priyanka Gupta: That’s intriguing! But how does it ensure security and reliability in collecting payments?

00:15:10 Srijan Amrit: Payment Forms leverage the same high-security protocols as HyperCredit. All transactions processed through the forms are encrypted, and like HyperCredit, are PCI-DSS compliant. Furthermore, you’ll have access to a customizable dashboard that allows you to manage payments, track conversion rates, and define specific workflows without needing advanced tech support.

00:15:30 Priyanka Gupta: I see. I’m assuming there’s a similar pricing model for Payment Forms?

00:15:40 Srijan Amrit: Exactly! The price for Payment Forms is 0.45% per transaction, and you’ll only pay when you successfully process payments through this solution. Again, it’s structured to support scalability, so as your transaction volume grows, the cost remains proportionate and transparent.

00:16:00 Priyanka Gupta: I like the structure, but I’m curious about how long it would take to fully implement both solutions. Could you give me an estimate?

00:16:20 Srijan Amrit: Generally speaking, integration can take around 4 to 6 weeks, depending on the complexity of your existing infrastructure and the team’s availability for testing phases. We typically start with an onboarding process where we gather requirements and set milestones. You’ll also have access to our integration specialists during this time for any questions or concerns.

00:16:40 Priyanka Gupta: That sounds manageable. Do you also provide any case studies or example implementations from businesses similar to ours?

00:17:00 Srijan Amrit: Yes, we have several case studies highlighting successful implementations. For example, we worked with an online retailer that faced similar issues with checkout abandonment. Post-implementation, they reported a 25% increase in approved loans at checkout and a significant decrease in transaction failures. I can send you those case studies for your review.

00:17:20 Priyanka Gupta: I’d appreciate that! I’m also curious about customer support after implementation. How does that typically look? 

00:17:30 Srijan Amrit: After the implementation phase, you’ll be assigned a dedicated account manager who will conduct a post-launch review and continuously monitor performance metrics. They will regularly check in with you to ensure everything is running smoothly. Any ongoing support can be accessed via our dedicated support line or email.

00:17:50 Priyanka Gupta: That’s quite comprehensive. One last question—how do we track performance once we’re up and running?

00:18:00 Srijan Amrit: We provide an intuitive analytics dashboard as part of the service. It includes insights into transaction volume, average loan amounts, customer application completion rates, and more. You can customize the reports based on the metrics that matter most to your business, making it easy to make strategic decisions going forward.

00:18:20 Priyanka Gupta: This sounds excellent, Srijan! Thanks so much for the detailed discussion. I’m feeling more confident about moving forward with you.

00:18:30 Srijan Amrit: I’m glad to hear that, Priyanka! I’ll follow up with the requested case studies and additional documentation on our services. Do you have any further questions or concerns for me today?

00:18:50 Priyanka Gupta: Not at the moment, but I’ll take some time to review everything. Thank you!

00:19:00 Srijan Amrit: My pleasure! I look forward to hearing back from you soon.
```
00:15:10 Srijan Amrit: I appreciate you taking the time to explore our solutions, Priyanka. Given your interest in improving the checkout experience and reducing transaction failures, I'd like to start with our NACH Mandates through LotusPay. It enables businesses to streamline recurring payments like subscriptions or EMIs with a remarkable 99% success rate. That could significantly enhance your customers' experience.

00:15:30 Priyanka Gupta: That sounds promising, Srijan. However, can you explain how this process works in the context of our current system? We have an existing payment gateway that we’re pretty reliant on.

00:15:45 Srijan Amrit: Definitely, that’s a great question. Integrating LotusPay is straightforward, as it can be accessed via REST APIs or through our user-friendly dashboard interface. You would start by enabling the NACH Mandates through our API, which would require just a few adjustments in your payment workflow. This can run alongside your existing gateway without a hitch, ensuring a seamless transition.

00:16:10 Priyanka Gupta: Seamless transition sounds good, but what about data security? Given the sensitive nature of payment information, we’re very particular about security protocols.

00:16:25 Srijan Amrit: Understandably so, and I appreciate your concern. LotusPay adheres to strict security standards, including PCI-DSS compliance. We leverage advanced encryption protocols to safeguard data both in transit and at rest. Additionally, regular security audits are conducted to ensure that our systems are resilient to threats.

00:16:50 Priyanka Gupta: That's reassuring. What about the pricing structure? You mentioned a fee of 0.20% per recurring payment. How does that compare with industry averages?

00:17:10 Srijan Amrit: Great question! The 0.20% fee is competitive, especially considering the high success rate we've achieved. Many solutions in the market often have hidden fees or higher rates, pushing your costs up with transaction volumes. This transparent pricing ensures you pay only for successful transactions. 

00:17:40 Priyanka Gupta: Understood. Now, if we consider volume—let’s say we have about 10,000 recurring transactions per month—what would the total cost look like?

00:17:55 Srijan Amrit: With 10,000 transactions, that would be approximately ₹20,000 per month, keeping your operational expenses predictable. Additionally, with increased transaction success rates, you may actually see a reduction in customer service inquiries related to payment failures, which could save you even more.

00:18:25 Priyanka Gupta: That’s definitely an advantage. I also noticed you mentioned the UPI TPAP SDK earlier. How would that enhance our payment capabilities beyond what we currently offer?

00:18:40 Srijan Amrit: The UPI TPAP SDK essentially transforms your app into a fully functional Third-Party Application Provider like GPay or PayTM. This means you can facilitate both peer-to-peer and peer-to-merchant transactions directly through your own app. It provides your customers with an integrated payment solution and supports a wide range of UPI transactions, enhancing user convenience and retention.

00:19:15 Priyanka Gupta: That’s quite useful! How does the integration process look for the UPI TPAP SDK, especially in terms of maintaining compatibility with our existing infrastructure?

00:19:30 Srijan Amrit: The integration process is designed to minimize disruption. Our SDK is modular, allowing it to work independently or alongside existing services. Our technical team would provide comprehensive documentation and assistance during the integration phase. We’d also conduct testing to ensure that your systems communicate effectively, so you can maintain high operational standards.

00:19:55 Priyanka Gupta: Speaking of support, what are the ongoing maintenance costs associated with both LotusPay and the UPI SDK?

00:20:10 Srijan Amrit: There’s no specific ongoing maintenance fee for either solution. However, should you require premium support or additional custom features, we offer tiered support options that can fit various business needs. We're committed to providing the necessary assistance throughout your journey with us.

00:20:45 Priyanka Gupta: That's good to know, but will those support options also help us with potential glitches or transaction failures?

00:21:00 Srijan Amrit: Absolutely! Our support teams are equipped to address transaction discrepancies or system glitches swiftly. We have a dedicated support portal, and you’ll have access to our SLA guarantees which ensure rapid resolution times. Plus, we continuously monitor transaction flows to detect and resolve issues proactively.

00:21:25 Priyanka Gupta: Excellent, and how quickly could we expect the integration to be completed once we decide to go ahead?

00:21:40 Srijan Amrit: Typically, the integration can be completed within 4 to 6 weeks, depending on the complexity of your existing systems and how quickly the necessary adjustments can be made. We prioritize a structured rollout to minimize operational interruptions, and our project management team will keep you updated throughout the process.

00:22:15 Priyanka Gupta: That sounds reasonable. Can you provide any case studies or examples of businesses similar to ours who've successfully implemented these solutions?

00:22:30 Srijan Amrit: Certainly! We have partnered with several e-commerce platforms that faced similar challenges. For instance, one client experienced a 40% reduction in payment failures and a significant uptick in customer retention within the first three months of implementing LotusPay. Their checkout experience became notably smoother, leading to higher conversion rates. 

00:22:55 Priyanka Gupta: That’s quite impressive. It's encouraging to hear about tangible benefits. Would we be able to potentially set up a demo either on LotusPay or the UPI SDK to visualize how the integration works?

00:23:15 Srijan Amrit: Absolutely, I’d be happy to arrange a demo! This way, you can see the functionalities in action. We can schedule a session tailored to your team's availability, and I’ll ensure we cover any specific scenarios you’d like to explore.

00:23:40 Priyanka Gupta: That sounds great! Could we possibly set that up for next week?

00:23:50 Srijan Amrit: Sure, I can offer several time slots throughout the week. Let’s pencil in Tuesday at 10:00 AM, or if that doesn’t suit, I can provide other options.

00:24:10 Priyanka Gupta: Tuesday at 10:00 AM works perfectly for me. I’ll sync with my team and let you know if we need to modify that.

00:24:20 Srijan Amrit: Fantastic! I’ll send you a calendar invite shortly. In the meantime, if you have any further questions or need clarification on any points, feel free to reach out.

00:24:35 Priyanka Gupta: Thank you, Srijan. I appreciate the thorough responses. I feel much more informed now about what you offer!

00:24:50 Srijan Amrit: Absolutely, and I look forward to the demo as well. I'm confident that our solutions can significantly enhance your operations. Thank you for the engaging conversation, Priyanka!

00:25:05 Priyanka Gupta: Thank you! Looking forward to it.
00:20:10 Srijan Amrit: So, Priyanka, I understand that improving your checkout experience and reducing transaction failures are top of mind for you. That's where our HyperUPI solution comes in. It enables 1-click in-app UPI payments directly on your checkout page with a customizable UI.

00:20:34 Priyanka Gupta: That sounds promising. Can you tell me how easy it is to integrate HyperUPI with our current e-commerce platform? We’re concerned about the technical effort and resources required.

00:20:48 Srijan Amrit: Absolutely. HyperUPI requires minimal changes to your current architecture. Our dev team provides an SDK that seamlessly integrates with most e-commerce platforms. We'd work closely with your developers to ensure the integration is smooth. On average, businesses see this done in about one to two weeks, depending on your system's complexity.

00:21:12 Priyanka Gupta: One to two weeks sounds feasible; could you clarify if there’s any specific technical requirement on our end or compatibility issues with any systems?

00:21:23 Srijan Amrit: Great question! In terms of technical requirements, HyperUPI supports REST APIs, and as long as your system can handle typical API calls, you should be fine. We’ve successfully integrated with platforms like Magento, Shopify, and WooCommerce. If you use a custom solution, our team will conduct an assessment and provide necessary guidelines.

00:21:53 Priyanka Gupta: That’s good to know! Now, I’m sure you’ve seen a range of transaction scenarios; could you tell me how HyperUPI handles transaction failures and what kinds of failure rates we might expect?

00:22:08 Srijan Amrit: Certainly! HyperUPI comes with built-in error handling and transaction tracking that significantly reduces failure rates, bringing them down to around 0.5%. The system retries failed transactions automatically, providing users with an option to complete their payments without frustration. Beyond that, our analytics dashboard will give you real-time insights into transaction trends, including failures, which can be useful for understanding and troubleshooting issues as they arise.

00:22:43 Priyanka Gupta: That's encouraging to hear! Security is another area I'd like to discuss. How does HyperUPI ensure the safety of our customer’s payment data?

00:22:55 Srijan Amrit: We take data security very seriously. HyperUPI employs end-to-end encryption for all transactions, meaning your customers' data is secure during transmission. Additionally, we comply with PCI DSS standards, and our system undergoes regular security audits. You’ll also have the option for two-factor authentication to add an extra layer of security during critical transactions.

00:23:24 Priyanka Gupta: That is reassuring. You mentioned PCI DSS compliance—could you explain what that entails in terms of our responsibilities?

00:23:34 Srijan Amrit: Of course! As an e-commerce business, you will need to ensure that your site is also compliant at a basic level, which includes regularly updating your security protocols, training employees on data handling, and maintaining secure systems. We provide guidance and support to help you through this process, so you’re not navigating it alone.

00:24:01 Priyanka Gupta: That definitely helps to understand our part. Now let’s talk about costs—how do you structure your pricing, and are there any hidden fees that we should be aware of?

00:24:13 Srijan Amrit: Our pricing is straightforward: we charge 0.15% per transaction. There are no hidden fees or setup costs associated with HyperUPI. The only additional charge could be based on specific advanced features you might choose to enable, but that would be clearly discussed upfront.

00:24:37 Priyanka Gupta: That seems reasonable. Are there any ongoing maintenance or support costs we should plan for after the integration?

00:24:47 Srijan Amrit: No additional maintenance fees at all! We offer ongoing support as part of the subscription at no extra cost. Our support team is readily available 24/7 to assist with any integration issues or general queries, providing peace of mind as your business grows.

00:25:09 Priyanka Gupta: Support availability is crucial for us. Speaking of growth, how does HyperUPI scale with increased transaction volumes, especially during peak shopping seasons?

00:25:22 Srijan Amrit: HyperUPI is built with scalability in mind. It employs load balancing and can handle significant spikes in traffic seamlessly. Whether it’s during holiday sales or special promotions, our infrastructure adjusts to demand without compromising on performance.

00:25:44 Priyanka Gupta: That's impressive! I’m also interested in knowing about the user experience. How will HyperUPI enhance the overall checkout experience for our customers?

00:25:58 Srijan Amrit: With HyperUPI, the checkout process becomes much smoother. Thanks to our 1-click payment feature, customers can make payments in less than three seconds, reducing drop-offs during checkout. The customizable UI means you can match the payment interface with your brand, ensuring that customers feel comfortable and familiar during their transactions.

00:26:23 Priyanka Gupta: A seamless UI is definitely something we need. What if we want to do A/B testing for the checkout process to see which design or method performs better?

00:26:36 Srijan Amrit: That’s an excellent strategy! HyperUPI provides the flexibility for A/B testing different payment interfaces. You can essentially run parallel checkout flows in our environment and use the analytics dashboard to measure performance, aiding in making data-driven decisions to optimize your checkout experience based on what your customers respond to best.

00:27:02 Priyanka Gupta: That insight into A/B testing sounds valuable. On a more technical front, how often do you roll out updates or new features, and how are those communicated to us?

00:27:16 Srijan Amrit: We aim to keep the platform current with ongoing improvements, and we release updates about every quarter. You'll receive detailed notes on new features and enhancements, with clear instructions on how to implement them. Our support team also conducts brief orientation sessions when significant changes are made to ensure you're getting the most out of the platform.

00:27:46 Priyanka Gupta: That’s very thorough. Lastly, could you summarize the unique selling points of HyperUPI from an e-commerce perspective?

00:27:58 Srijan Amrit: Certainly! The key selling points for HyperUPI include: 

1. Seamless, 1-click UPI payments that drastically reduce checkout time and drop-offs.
2. A customizable UI that blends with your brand, ensuring a familiar experience for your customers.
3. Robust security measures that protect customer data while ensuring compliance with industry standards.
4. No hidden fees, with clear and straightforward transaction-based pricing.
5. Scalability that keeps performance intact during peak traffic times, coupled with ongoing 24/7 support.

00:28:45 Priyanka Gupta: That encapsulation does capture the essence of what we’re looking for. I appreciate your clarity throughout this conversation. 

00:28:57 Srijan Amrit: Thank you, Priyanka! I’m glad this has been helpful. If you have any further questions or need deeper insights, I’m here to assist. Would you like to schedule a follow-up to discuss the next steps in implementation?

00:29:15 Priyanka Gupta: Yes, definitely! Let’s arrange a follow-up to explore this further and perhaps introduce this concept to my technical team as well.

00:29:28 Srijan Amrit: Perfect! I’ll send you a calendar invite for a meeting next week. We can also prepare some targeted resources for your team, so they have everything they need to assess the integration comprehensively.

00:29:45 Priyanka Gupta: That sounds great. Thank you, Srijan. 

00:29:51 Srijan Amrit: Thank you, Priyanka. Looking forward to our next discussion!

00:25:10 Srijan Amrit: Thank you for our conversation today, Priyanka. Let's dive straight into how our products can enhance your e-commerce operations. I understand your primary concern is improving the checkout experience and reducing transaction failures. Juspay Payout could be a game-changer here. It streamlines the refund process and ensures quick fund transfers when issues arise.

00:25:35 Priyanka Gupta: Absolutely, Srijan. We have been facing challenges with delayed refunds and a convoluted payment process. Can you elaborate on how Juspay Payout integrates with existing systems?

00:25:48 Srijan Amrit: Sure! Our integration process is designed to be seamless. Juspay Payout comes with extensive API documentation to facilitate smooth connectivity with your current e-commerce platform. You would initiate a payout through our API, handle it with minimal additional code, ensuring it fits right into your existing workflows. Plus, it has built-in support for various payout methods such as bank accounts, UPI IDs, and even cards or wallets.

00:26:20 Priyanka Gupta: That sounds promising. Can you clarify how secure these transactions are? Data security is a primary concern for us, especially since we deal with sensitive customer information.

00:26:35 Srijan Amrit: Of course! We prioritize security at every level. Juspay Payout adheres to strict PCI DSS compliance guidelines, ensuring that payment data is encrypted and securely transmitted. Our solution employs tokenization to safeguard sensitive information, minimizing risks even further. This means that even if a transaction is intercepted, the transmitted information is virtually useless to unauthorized parties.

00:27:04 Priyanka Gupta: Great to hear that! And what about the costs involved? You mentioned a fee of 0.25% per payout transaction—are there any hidden fees we should be aware of?

00:27:15 Srijan Amrit: That's a good question, Priyanka. The 0.25% fee applies directly to each transaction processed through Juspay Payout, and there are no hidden fees. We believe in complete transparency. Your only ongoing costs would be that transactional fee; we don’t charge for integration or maintenance separately.

00:27:38 Priyanka Gupta: Fair enough! Now, regarding ongoing support, what does your customer service include after we’ve integrated the solution?

00:27:47 Srijan Amrit: Our support team is available 24/7 for any issues you may face post-integration. We provide comprehensive help documentation and dedicated account management for enterprise-level clients. Additionally, we conduct quarterly reviews to adapt and ensure our solutions meet your evolving needs.

00:28:10 Priyanka Gupta: Sounds good! Now, regarding your other product, the JusBiz - Virtual Cards Solution: how does it fit into our operational model, particularly regarding supplier payments?

00:28:23 Srijan Amrit: JusBiz is particularly useful for making repeat transactions secure and efficient. By issuing virtual cards for specific suppliers, you can manage and track expenses better while ensuring security. These cards allow you to set limits and expiration dates, providing an added layer of control. The cost here is 0.35% per transaction. 

00:28:48 Priyanka Gupta: I see! Is there a risk of fraud with virtual cards? 

00:28:52 Srijan Amrit: Not at all, Priyanka. Because our virtual cards are randomly generated for each transaction, they limit exposure to fraud. If a card number is compromised or misused, it can be immediately deactivated without impacting your overall account security. Additionally, we utilize real-time transaction monitoring to flag any suspicious activities.

00:29:19 Priyanka Gupta: That’s reassuring. How complicated is it to implement the virtual card solution within our existing payment infrastructure?

00:29:27 Srijan Amrit: It’s quite straightforward! Our virtual card service integrates via API as well, similar to Payout. You can initiate card creation and transactions directly from your existing order management systems. It only involves adding our API endpoints to your workflow with minimal adjustments. 

00:29:50 Priyanka Gupta: Amazing! So, is there a recommended setup time for both services?

00:29:54 Srijan Amrit: Typically, it takes about two to four weeks for smooth integration, depending on your IT infrastructure and resource availability. Our technical team will work closely with you to ensure everything is configured per your requirements and you are up and running as quickly as possible.

00:30:15 Priyanka Gupta: That sounds very efficient. Once we integrate, are there any tools to analyze the transaction success ratio or issues?

00:30:22 Srijan Amrit: Yes, we offer a comprehensive dashboard that allows you to analyze all transactions in real-time. You can track success rates, identify failure points, and draw insights from this data to improve your payment processes further. 

00:30:38 Priyanka Gupta: Excellent! After assessing our workflow further, I’d like to do a product demo and gather feedback from my team. Can we schedule a follow-up meeting?

00:30:48 Srijan Amrit: Definitely! I can arrange for a demo within the next week. A time slot of about one hour would allow us to dive deeper into the functionality and the integration process. Shall we schedule for next Wednesday?

00:31:05 Priyanka Gupta: That works for me. Could you also prepare a breakdown of estimated costs based on our average monthly transaction volume?

00:31:13 Srijan Amrit: Absolutely! I’ll send over the cost breakdown and a calendar invite for our demo. I look forward to showcasing how we can make your processes smoother and more efficient!

00:31:24 Priyanka Gupta: Thanks, Srijan! Looking forward to the demo.
