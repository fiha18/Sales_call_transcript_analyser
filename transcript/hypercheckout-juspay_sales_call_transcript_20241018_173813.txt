00:00:00 Rahul Kothari (Fintech Company): Hello, Kailash! I hope you’re doing well today.

00:00:02 Kailash Nath (E-commerce Business): Hi Rahul! I’m doing good, thanks. How about you?

00:00:05 Rahul Kothari: I’m great, thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today. I wanted to discuss how our Juspay Hypercheckout SDK can help enhance your e-commerce payment systems.

00:00:10 Kailash Nath: Sure, I’m interested to hear more, especially how it can integrate with our current systems.

00:00:15 Rahul Kothari: Absolutely. Our Hypercheckout SDK is designed as a fully managed, native cross-platform payments experience orchestrator. This means it can seamlessly blend with both your app and website. Integration is straightforward, requiring minimal tech investment.

00:00:30 Kailash Nath: That sounds promising, but I’m concerned about the integration costs and how intrusive it might be on our existing infrastructure.

00:00:35 Rahul Kothari: I understand that concern. The beauty of Hypercheckout is that it’s built to be a future-proof payments toolkit. It facilitates an easy onboarding process for various payment processors, which could optimize your transaction costs and processing times. Plus, any necessary adjustments can be managed via our dashboard without extensive app releases.

00:00:55 Kailash Nath: That’s a relief to hear. What about security? We handle a lot of sensitive customer data, and that’s always a top priority for us.

00:01:00 Rahul Kothari: Definitely, security is paramount. Juspay is a certified Token Requestor under RBI guidelines, which means we ensure compliance and security at all levels. Customer payment details are securely tokenized, which mitigates the risk associated with data breaches.

00:01:25 Kailash Nath: That’s good to know. What about scalability? As we grow, we need a solution that can handle increased transaction volumes without compromising performance.

00:01:30 Rahul Kothari: Hypercheckout is built to scale. It offers dynamic routing algorithms that adjust in real-time to optimize payment success rates based on available gateway performance. This means no matter how traffic increases, our system finds the best route for each transaction to ensure high success rates.

00:01:55 Kailash Nath: Okay, that’s reassuring. Can you tell me more about the payment options available with Hypercheckout?

00:02:00 Rahul Kothari: Of course! Hypercheckout supports a wide array of payment flows including cards, net banking, UPI, wallets, and even Buy Now Pay Later options. Each flow is optimized for customer conversion, and we handle things like EMI options, which include both standard and no-cost EMI variants.

00:02:25 Kailash Nath: That’s quite comprehensive. Given the variety of payment methods, how does your SDK manage customer experience?

00:02:30 Rahul Kothari: The user experience is highly optimized. The checkout interface can be customized to blend seamlessly with your app’s branding, and we have over 100 configurations available to tailor the experience. Plus, we have app-invoke journeys for payment providers like GPay and Paytm, which significantly enhance conversion rates.

00:02:55 Kailash Nath: Sounds like it could greatly enhance our user experience. Now, let’s talk pricing. How does your pricing structure work for startups like ours?

00:03:00 Rahul Kothari: Sure, for startups, we have a pricing model starting at 0.35% per transaction or ₹20,000 a month, whichever is higher. It scales down to 0.25% for larger transaction volumes. This offers flexibility based on your growth.

00:03:20 Kailash Nath: That seems manageable, but I still need to evaluate whether this aligns with our budget. How does it compare to what we’re currently using?

00:03:25 Rahul Kothari: I completely understand needing to assess cost-efficiency. Many clients have reported significant reductions in transaction costs and processing times after switching to our system. The investment often pays off through improved conversion rates and reduced operational workload.

00:03:50 Kailash Nath: Okay, that makes sense. Are there any hidden charges we should be aware of?

00:03:55 Rahul Kothari: We pride ourselves on transparency. The only additional costs might arise from transactions processed through third-party payment processors, which are entirely dependent on their fee structures. We can help clarify those during integration.

00:04:15 Kailash Nath: Great, that’s helpful information. What are the next steps if we decide we want to see a demo?

00:04:20 Rahul Kothari: If you’re ready, we can schedule a demo at your convenience to walk you through the actual integration process and showcase the product. I can also provide you with detailed case studies from similar clients who have benefited from Hypercheckout.

00:04:40 Kailash Nath: Sure, I think that would be valuable. I’ll need to consult with my team as well, but how about we aim for a demo later this week?

00:04:45 Rahul Kothari: Sounds good! I can adjust my schedule accordingly. What day works best for you?

00:04:50 Kailash Nath: How about Thursday afternoon?

00:04:55 Rahul Kothari: Perfect! I’ll send a calendar invite for Thursday at 2 PM. We look forward to showing you how seamless the integration can be!

00:05:05 Kailash Nath: Great, thanks Rahul! I appreciate the insights today. 

00:05:10 Rahul Kothari: Thank you for your time, Kailash! I’m excited to continue our conversation soon!

00:05:15 Kailash Nath: Talk to you then. Bye!

00:05:20 Rahul Kothari: Bye!
