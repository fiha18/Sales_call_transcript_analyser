00:00:00 Rahul Kothari : Hi Kailash Nath, thanks for taking the time today. Let's discuss how we can improve your payment solutions.
00:00:05 Kailash Nath: Sure, I’m excited to learn more about your offerings.
00:0:10 Rahul Kothari: Thank you for giving me the opportunity to discuss your requirements, Kailash. I understand your company is keen on improving the checkout experience and reducing transaction failures, is that correct?

00:0:20 Kailash Nath: Yes, precisely. Our current checkout experience isn't as smooth as we’d like it to be, and transaction failures can hamper our revenue significantly.

00:0:30 Rahul Kothari: That’s definitely a challenge. I’d recommend looking into our HyperCheckout solution. It is a pre-built, customizable payment page UI designed for fast integration with minimal development effort. It supports multiple payment methods like UPI, cards, net banking, and wallets. The pricing model is 0.35% per transaction, which provides an affordable option as you scale. 

00:0:52 Kailash Nath: Interesting. Can you elaborate on how the integration works with our existing systems? 

00:1:00 Rahul Kothari: Absolutely. HyperCheckout is designed to integrate seamlessly, whether you’re using a CMS, a native app, or any other framework. We have extensive documentation and SDKs that simplify the setup process. 

00:1:12 Kailash Nath: That sounds promising. But what about the actual implementation? How long does that typically take, and what kind of ongoing support do you provide?

00:1:24 Rahul Kothari: Great question. Typically, businesses can get up and running within a couple of days—especially if you’re leveraging our step-by-step integration guides. We also offer ongoing support via chat, email, or phone, ensuring that you have assistance anytime you need it. Our team proactively monitors transactions and will notify you in case of any issues, so you can focus on growing your business.

00:1:50 Kailash Nath: Monitoring is key for us since transaction failures can be a headache. Speaking of failures, how do you ensure the security of these transactions?

00:2:00 Rahul Kothari: We take security very seriously. HyperCheckout uses advanced encryption standards, PCI DSS compliance, and tokenization to keep both your customers' data and your business secure. We also implement fraud detection algorithms to proactively identify unusual transaction patterns.

00:2:22 Kailash Nath: That's reassuring. However, can you provide more details on the pricing—specifically around how transaction fees get assessed and would there be any hidden costs?

00:2:35 Rahul Kothari: Of course. The 0.35% fee per transaction is straightforward with no hidden costs. What you see is what you pay. However, if you decide to scale up with our Express Checkout SDK, that offers advanced features at a slightly lower rate of 0.30% per transaction. Both options allow for seamless onboarding and ease of maintenance.

00:2:58 Kailash Nath: And how do the transactions scale? For instance, if our volume grows significantly, will pricing structure change?

00:3:06 Rahul Kothari: Our pricing structure remains consistent, which helps you plan your expenses better. However, as transaction volumes increase, we can discuss customized plans or rate reductions, depending on your needs. The HyperCheckout and SDK solutions are engineered for scalability, accommodating any growth trajectory.

00:3:28 Kailash Nath: That's good to know. Are there any significant differences in features between HyperCheckout and the Express Checkout SDK we should be aware of?

00:3:38 Rahul Kothari: Yes, while HyperCheckout offers an out-of-the-box solution perfect for businesses looking to implement quickly, the Express Checkout SDK targets developers wanting a highly customizable checkout experience. It enables you to build layouts and workflows tailored to your app’s unique needs. It also taps into our secure backend, maintaining your data protection needs.

00:4:04 Kailash Nath: Customization could be great for us, but how complex would that development effort be?

00:4:10 Rahul Kothari: The integration process is actually quite manageable, especially with our detailed documentation. Developers generally find it easier than anticipated. Plus, we offer dedicated technical support during the integration phase to ensure a smooth experience.

00:4:28 Kailash Nath: That’s very helpful! I appreciate how you’re covering the bases. How does your support system work long-term? What if we encounter issues after the initial integration?

00:4:40 Rahul Kothari: Post-integration, we offer comprehensive support plans tailored to your needs. Our customer success team conducts regular check-ins with you and is available around the clock for any urgent technical issues.

00:5:05 Kailash Nath: Thanks, Rahul. This has been very insightful. I’m leaning towards exploring this further.

00:5:10 Rahul Kothari: I’d be happy to assist in moving forward or setting up a demo to address any specific areas you want to explore!00:5:10 Rahul Kothari: So, Kailash, as I understand it, you’re specifically looking to enhance your checkout experience and tackle transaction failures, right? This is where our Express Checkout API and HyperCredit solutions can come into play effectively.

00:5:23 Kailash Nath: Yes, absolutely. We’ve noticed that our current checkout process is causing some frustration for our customers, which in turn affects our sales. Can you tell me more about how the Express Checkout API works in terms of integration?

00:5:38 Rahul Kothari: Of course! The Express Checkout API is designed with simplicity in mind. It uses RESTful endpoints, which means you can easily integrate it into your existing architecture—whether that's a mobile app or a web application. The API allows you to create a custom payment experience that meets your specific needs, supporting all major payment methods like credit, debit, and wallets.

00:5:58 Kailash Nath: That sounds promising. But what about the back-end integration? How complicated is that?

00:6:03 Rahul Kothari: Great question! The integration process is straightforward and well-documented. We provide comprehensive SDKs and sample code to help you get started. Once integrated, our API manages authentication and payment processing, minimizing what you need to handle on your end. You also benefit from a JSON response format for ease of handling transactions.

00:6:25 Kailash Nath: Okay, but I am concerned about data security. How do you ensure customer data is protected during these transactions?

00:6:33 Rahul Kothari: Security is a top priority for us. We adhere to the latest PCI-DSS compliance standards to ensure that sensitive data is protected during transactions. Our API uses tokenization, which means that customer card details aren’t stored on your servers. Instead, we handle that securely, providing you a unique token for processing payments. This significantly reduces your risk exposure.

00:6:59 Kailash Nath: That makes sense. You mentioned handling multiple payment methods. Can you clarify how that works in practice?

00:7:06 Rahul Kothari: Absolutely! Our Express Checkout API is designed to accommodate various payment methods in a single platform. So whether a customer chooses to pay via credit card, UPI, or even e-wallets, the API intelligently streamlines the process to accommodate their preferred method. You’ll also have access to a dashboard that tracks transaction modes and performance analytics in real-time.

00:7:32 Kailash Nath: Nice! What about issues I might encounter post-integration? What ongoing support do you offer?

00:7:39 Rahul Kothari: We offer dedicated customer support tailored to each client, so you’ll never feel left alone after integration. Our support team is available 24/7 and is well-equipped to help you with any issues or questions that arise. Plus, we provide regular updates to both the API and associated documentation to keep your system current with evolving standards.

00:7:59 Kailash Nath: That sounds good, but what happens if I need to scale? Is the API and system capable of handling increased volume as we grow?

00:8:06 Rahul Kothari: Definitely! Our solution is built to be highly scalable. The Express Checkout API can handle thousands of transactions per second with zero degradation in performance. As your e-commerce business grows, our infrastructure will adjust seamlessly to accommodate your needs without you having to make any drastic changes.

00:8:27 Kailash Nath: That's reassuring. Moving on to financing, how would HyperCredit fit into my business model?

00:8:34 Rahul Kothari: HyperCredit serves to enhance customer experience by offering financing options right at checkout. It simplifies the entire loan process—from application to disbursement—which can improve cart conversion rates. The integration would be within your checkout flow, which means you can provide immediate financing options to your customers who need them as part of their payment choices.

00:8:56 Kailash Nath: That’s interesting. But how do we handle the payment cycle for loans? 

00:9:00 Rahul Kothari: Each transaction you process through HyperCredit takes care of the loan repayment cycle systematically. You’ll have control over minimal down payments and flexible repayment terms, and we work with multiple lenders to get the best options for your customers. We also provide necessary compliance and risk management tools, so you won’t have to navigate this alone.

00:9:24 Kailash Nath: Sounds very comprehensive. What’s the pricing structure for the services you've described?

00:9:29 Rahul Kothari: For Express Checkout API, we charge 0.25% per successful transaction, while HyperCredit costs 0.40% per loan transaction. These rates cover everything from integrations to ongoing support. 

00:9:44 Kailash Nath: And there are no hidden fees?

00:9:47 Rahul Kothari: Correct! Transparency is crucial for us. The only fees incurred would be based on the transactions themselves, ensuring you know exactly what you’re paying for each month.

00:10:01 Kailash Nath: Thanks for clarifying that, Rahul. I think I have a clearer picture now of how your products can help me. 

00:10:10 Rahul Kothari: I’m glad to hear that! If you have any more questions as you discuss this with your team, feel free to reach out. I’m here to help!00:10:10 Rahul Kothari: Our Payment Forms could really enhance your checkout experience by streamlining the payment process. Given that you’re looking to improve conversion rates, this lightweight solution allows you to collect payments without requiring a full website integration. You can promote your products or services just by sharing a link!

00:10:26 Kailash Nath: That sounds interesting. But I’m concerned about how this will integrate into our current system. We have some legacy infrastructure that requires careful handling. 

00:10:38 Rahul Kothari: I completely understand. The great thing about Payment Forms is that they require absolutely no technical background to set up. You would simply create a form, customize it according to your branding, and then share the link through your existing platforms. It provides an API endpoint as well for advanced users wanting to delve deeper.

00:10:57 Kailash Nath: Okay, that sounds manageable. But what about security? Payment processing is a sensitive matter and our customers' data must remain secure.

00:11:05 Rahul Kothari: Absolutely, and that’s a top priority for us. We comply with PCI DSS standards, and our systems are encrypted to ensure data integrity and security. Additionally, all payment methods support secure tokenization, which adds another layer of protection for sensitive information. 

00:11:25 Kailash Nath: Good to know. I want to provide multiple payment options at checkout. Can your solution support that?

00:11:30 Rahul Kothari: Yes, it does! Our system supports a wide range of payment methods, including credit cards, debit cards, UPI, and digital wallets. This flexibility is essential in minimizing transaction failures and improving the overall customer experience.

00:11:51 Kailash Nath: I appreciate that. Now, regarding transaction fees, can you break down the costs associated with using Payment Forms? 

00:11:58 Rahul Kothari: Certainly! For each transaction processed through the Payment Form, there’s a fee of just 0.45%. This is competitive and allows you to keep most of your earnings. Additionally, there are no monthly fees or hidden costs, making budgeting straightforward.

00:12:18 Kailash Nath: Sounds reasonable, but what about recurring payments? We have a subscription model in place. How does that work?

00:12:25 Rahul Kothari: For your subscription model, our NACH Mandates, known as LotusPay, would be perfect. They enable seamless collection of recurring payments, such as subscriptions or EMIs, with a remarkable 99% success rate. You can access it through REST APIs or our dashboard, giving you flexibility in how you want to manage your subscriptions.

00:12:48 Kailash Nath: That’s definitely something we need. What type of technical support do you provide during the integration, especially since our team might need assistance?

00:13:00 Rahul Kothari: We offer comprehensive onboarding support, including integration assistance and detailed documentation. Our dedicated customer support team is just a call away if you run into any issues. We also provide regular updates and ongoing maintenance, ensuring you’re always up-to-date with the latest features and security measures.

00:13:23 Kailash Nath: All right. Can you confirm if the data is stored securely? We need to comply with regulations, especially since we’re dealing with recurring payments.

00:13:30 Rahul Kothari: Yes, your data will be securely stored using advanced encryption and compliance with regulations like GDPR and PCI DSS. We continuously audit our systems to ensure they meet the highest security standards, minimizing risks of data breaches.

00:13:51 Kailash Nath: Well, it sounds like you have strong security measures in place. However, scalability is also a priority for us. If we grow rapidly, can your solution scale accordingly?

00:14:01 Rahul Kothari: Absolutely! Our solutions are designed with scalability in mind. Whether you’re processing hundreds or thousands of transactions, our infrastructure can handle increased loads efficiently. Our cloud-based architecture allows for rapid scaling without compromising performance.

00:14:23 Kailash Nath: That’s comforting to hear. Lastly, how quickly can we implement these solutions? We are looking for a timeframe.

00:14:30 Rahul Kothari: Once you decide, implementing the Payment Forms can take just a few days to set up. For NACH Mandates, the integration process typically ranges from one to two weeks, depending on the requirements. We aim to make the onboarding process as swift as possible to get you up and running.

00:14:52 Kailash Nath: Great! This definitely gives me a clearer picture of how both solutions can address our needs. 

00:14:56 Rahul Kothari: I’m glad to hear that! Let’s schedule a follow-up meeting to dive deeper into customization and your specific integration requirements.00:15:10 Rahul Kothari: Absolutely, Kailash. The UPI TPAP SDK and HyperUPI can significantly enhance your checkout experience. First, with the UPI TPAP SDK, you can turn your app into a fully functional TPAP like GPay or PayTM which means you can process both P2P and P2M transactions directly within your platform.

00:15:29 Kailash Nath: That sounds promising, but can you explain how the integration process works? My team has some concerns about compatibility with our existing systems.

00:15:39 Rahul Kothari: Great question! The integration is designed to be seamless. Our SDK offers well-documented APIs that your developers can easily implement. There are libraries available in multiple programming languages, so they can pick what works best with your tech stack. We take care of the backend complexity while you focus on your app's frontend.

00:15:59 Kailash Nath: That does sound manageable, but how does it handle transaction failures, which have been a recurring issue for us?

00:16:06 Rahul Kothari: The SDK includes robust error handling mechanisms. It automatically retries transactions based on specific failure codes and provides real-time notifications for your team to address any issues promptly. Plus, HyperUPI can enhance this by allowing for one-click payments, which reduces the likelihood of failures altogether. A quicker checkout means fewer abandoned carts.

00:16:27 Kailash Nath: I see. Can you elaborate on the security protocols in place? Data security is top of mind for us with sensitive transaction data being processed.

00:16:36 Rahul Kothari: Absolutely! We comply with the highest industry standards, including PCI DSS. Every transaction is encrypted, using strong cryptographic standards, and we implement two-factor authentication to further safeguard the process. In addition, we perform regular security audits to ensure our systems are resilient against potential threats.

00:16:56 Kailash Nath: That’s reassuring. Now let’s talk about costs. You mentioned that the UPI TPAP pricing is at 0.30% per transaction. Can you break down if there are any hidden fees?

00:17:07 Rahul Kothari: Sure! The 0.30% is straightforward—it's a flat fee per transaction without any hidden costs. HyperUPI is even more economical at 0.15% per transaction. We aim for transparency, so you can budget effectively without worrying about fluctuating fees. The main costs associated would be infrastructure and the potential development time.

00:17:31 Kailash Nath: That’s clear, but my concern is also about ongoing support and maintenance. Once we integrate, what kind of support do you provide?

00:17:39 Rahul Kothari: We have a dedicated support team available 24/7 to assist you. Whether it’s troubleshooting issues or helping with updates, we ensure that your operations remain uninterrupted. There is also a dedicated account manager who will coordinate with your team regularly to assess any evolving needs or additional features you might want to implement.

00:18:02 Kailash Nath: Okay, that sounds good. Now, what about scalability? Our growth has been exponential recently, and we need solutions that can grow with us.

00:18:10 Rahul Kothari: Both UPI TPAP SDK and HyperUPI are built with scalability in mind. They can easily handle increases in transaction volume. Our cloud infrastructure can support scaling horizontally as your user base grows. It’s designed to adapt to higher loads without compromising performance or transaction speed.

00:18:34 Kailash Nath: That sounds essential for us. How long would you estimate the integration process would take for our size?

00:18:40 Rahul Kothari: Depending on your current infrastructure and your team’s familiarity with payment integrations, it can take anywhere from a few days to a couple of weeks to implement and go live. Our team will work closely with you during this period to ensure a smooth transition.

00:19:03 Kailash Nath: Fantastic, that’s a reasonable time frame. I appreciate the clarity on all this. 

00:19:08 Rahul Kothari: No problem! Once you decide to move forward, we’ll schedule a kickoff meeting to align on timelines and resources. Understanding your needs is our priority. 

00:19:18 Kailash Nath: I look forward to that. Thanks for providing all the details, Rahul. 

00:19:23 Rahul Kothari: You’re welcome, Kailash. Excited to partner and help enhance your payment processing!00:20:10 Rahul Kothari: Thank you for taking the time, Kailash. To dive right in, I understand you're looking to enhance your checkout experience and reduce transaction failures. Our Juspay Payout solution can be a game changer for that. It efficiently handles large-scale payouts and refunds, and supports various payment methods like bank accounts, UPI IDs, cards, and wallets. 

00:20:30 Kailash Nath: That sounds promising, Rahul. Can you elaborate on how Juspay Payout would integrate with our existing systems? 

00:20:36 Rahul Kothari: Absolutely! The integration process is seamless. We provide a robust API that can be easily integrated into your e-commerce platform. First, there’s a setup phase where we coordinate with your development team. Our API documentation includes various endpoints that allow you to initiate payouts or process refunds instantly. 

00:20:59 Kailash Nath: What about security? Given the sensitive nature of financial transactions, I'm sure you can appreciate our concerns.

00:21:05 Rahul Kothari: Definitely. Security is one of our top priorities. Juspay employs end-to-end encryption for all transactions, which means that data is protected during transfers. We are also PCI-DSS compliant, ensuring that your business adheres to industry-leading security standards. Plus, we regularly conduct vulnerability assessments and penetration tests to maintain the integrity of our systems.

00:21:33 Kailash Nath: That sounds reassuring. Can you share how you handle the scale? We often experience peak periods during sale events. 

00:21:40 Rahul Kothari: Great question! Juspay Payout is designed with scalability in mind. Our infrastructure can automatically scale based on transaction volume. We use a cloud-based system that allows you to handle spikes in transactions without lag or downtime. Our load balancing features ensure that even during high traffic, your customers will have a smooth experience.

00:22:05 Kailash Nath: Speaking of smooth experiences, how do you ensure minimal transaction failures? 

00:22:10 Rahul Kothari: We implement several optimizations, including a retry mechanism for failed transactions. If a payment fails due to a temporary issue—like account verification or network issues—our system automatically retries the transaction after a short interval. This significantly minimizes user frustration and increases successful transaction rates.

00:22:33 Kailash Nath: Nice! And how is pricing structured for these transactions?

00:22:37 Rahul Kothari: Our pricing model is straightforward. For every payout transaction you process through Juspay Payout, there's a nominal fee of 0.25%. For our JusBiz virtual cards, it's 0.35% per transaction. This gives you flexibility because you'll only pay for what you use without any hidden costs.

00:23:01 Kailash Nath: That's clear. However, I want to know more about ongoing support. Once we integrate, how can we be sure you’ll help us maintain the system?

00:23:09 Rahul Kothari: Excellent point. We provide comprehensive ongoing support post-integration. You’ll have access to our dedicated support team, available via chat or email, and we also offer regular system health checks to ensure everything runs smoothly. Additionally, we conduct quarterly reviews to go over performance metrics and discuss any needed enhancements. 

00:23:33 Kailash Nath: It sounds like your team would be available whenever issues arise, which is crucial. What would the next steps look like if we decided to move forward?

00:23:40 Rahul Kothari: The next steps would include setting up a detailed demo to showcase the integrations live with your existing systems, and we can address any additional questions or custom requirements you may have at that time. After that, we can create a project timeline for the integration, which would include testing and training your team. 

00:24:02 Kailash Nath: That sounds like a worthwhile plan. Could we also include some of our technical team members in the demo session later?

00:24:08 Rahul Kothari: Absolutely, that would be beneficial. I'll ensure to coordinate that so they can see how our payment systems can mesh with what you currently have in place. 

00:24:20 Kailash Nath: Perfect! I’m looking forward to it. 

00:24:22 Rahul Kothari: I’ll follow up with a calendar invite for our demo and we can set a date that works best for your technical team. Thank you again for your time, Kailash.
