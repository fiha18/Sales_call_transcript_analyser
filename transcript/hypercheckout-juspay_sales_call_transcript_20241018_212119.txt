00:00:00 Rahul Kothari (fintech.com): Hi Kailash, thanks for taking the time to chat today! How are you?

00:00:02 Kailash Nath (ecommerce.com): Hi Rahul, I’m doing well, thank you. Just busy catching up after the holiday season. How about you?

00:00:05 Rahul Kothari: I’m doing great, thanks! I know the post-holiday rush can be intense. I really appreciate you squeezing this call in. 

00:00:15 Kailash Nath: No problem at all. I’m looking forward to learning more about Juspay. We've been facing some challenges with our checkout experience and transaction failures, so your timing is perfect.

00:00:22 Rahul Kothari: Ah, that’s a key area we can definitely help with! At Juspay, we focus on improving payment experiences with our solution Hypercheckout, which has proved valuable for similar businesses. Why don’t we start with your current setup? What specific challenges are you experiencing with your checkout process?

00:00:40 Kailash Nath: Right now, we’re experiencing a pretty high cart abandonment rate during checkout. It seems like a lot of our customers are facing issues with transaction failures, and it's affecting our overall conversion.

00:00:55 Rahul Kothari: That’s a common issue, obviously frustrating for any e-commerce business. Hypercheckout is designed to optimize those conversion rates by reducing friction during the checkout process. It offers adaptable features that support multiple payment methods in a seamless manner. Can you share what payment methods you currently support?

00:01:15 Kailash Nath: We mainly offer cards, UPI, and a couple of wallet options, but we’ve heard our customers asking for more, especially Buy Now Pay Later options.

00:01:23 Rahul Kothari: That aligns perfectly! Hypercheckout supports a variety of payment flows, including all the ones you mentioned as well as EMI options, multiple wallet integrations, and extensive BNPL solutions. This breadth ensures customers have options, significantly contributing to improving user experience and reducing abandonment rates. 

00:01:45 Kailash Nath: That sounds promising. But how easily can we integrate this into our existing system? We’ve already invested a lot in our infrastructure, and I want to ensure that the integration won't be disruptive or costly.

00:01:57 Rahul Kothari: Absolutely, that’s a critical aspect. Our integration is designed to be straightforward and can be tailored to fit into various existing architectures, whether it’s a native app or a web application. We provide SDKs for platforms like Android, iOS, and web, as well as support for frameworks like Flutter and React Native.

00:02:18 Kailash Nath: That’s definitely helpful. But what about the costs associated with the integration? We need to keep an eye on our expenditures.

00:02:25 Rahul Kothari: Great question! We offer flexible pricing models. For startups, the transaction fee is 0.35% per transaction plus a subscription fee of ₹20,000 per month. We can also discuss a discounted option of 0.25% per transaction or ₹15,000 per month, whichever is higher, to keep costs manageable. 

00:02:50 Kailash Nath: I see. And in terms of data security, particularly since we deal with sensitive information, what measures do you have in place?

00:02:59 Rahul Kothari: Security is our top priority. Hypercheckout is compliant with RBI guidelines and features Card-on-File Tokenization to protect user data. Additionally, we utilize mobile number-based OTP authentication for transactions, ensuring a double layer of security against fraudulent activities.

00:03:20 Kailash Nath: That's very reassuring. Security breaches can be disastrous for us. Also, how do you ensure transaction success rates given the varying dynamics of online payments? 

00:03:29 Rahul Kothari: Our platform leverages dynamic routing algorithms that monitor payment failures in real-time. If a transaction fails, Hypercheckout can automatically redirect it through another route or payment processor to optimize success rates, minimizing disruptions for your customers during checkout.

00:03:50 Kailash Nath: Impressive! Scheduling configuration changes can also be quite cumbersome from the development side. Does your platform offer any solutions there?

00:03:56 Rahul Kothari: Yes, it does! We provide Over-the-Air (OTA) updates that allow for real-time configuration changes without requiring your team to push constant updates in your app. You can seamlessly manage styling, payment methods, and more through our dashboard, all while keeping your app’s capabilities intact.

00:04:20 Kailash Nath: That sounds very convenient. The reduced need for maintenance would definitely alleviate some pressure from our dev team. Speaking of which, how user-friendly is the dashboard? 

00:04:30 Rahul Kothari: The Juspay Dashboard is designed for ease of use. It gives you full control over payment routing, transaction monitoring, and refund management while providing detailed analytics. You can gain insights into customer behaviors, checkout performance, and even fine-tune your payment strategies based on that data.

00:04:52 Kailash Nath: Sounds like a powerful tool. Can you walk me through a common use case where businesses benefitted from using Hypercheckout?

00:04:59 Rahul Kothari: Of course! We recently partnered with an e-commerce platform that was struggling with a high drop-off rate during checkout. They integrated Hypercheckout and added options like EMI and Buy Now Pay Later. Within a few months, their conversion rate improved by over 25%, equating to significant revenue growth. 

00:05:22 Kailash Nath: That’s impressive! I’m very interested in exploring this further. Can we also consider how we would migrate existing users onto your platform?

00:05:30 Rahul Kothari: Certainly! We can support a phased rollout of the integration, allowing you to migrate users gradually. This minimizes the risk of user disruption and enables you to monitor and adapt as needed. Plus, we support transferring some user account details, like saved cards or wallets, ensuring a seamless experience.

00:05:52 Kailash Nath: That’s comforting to hear. One last concern—what kind of support can we expect post-integration?

00:06:00 Rahul Kothari: We offer extensive support, including onboarding assistance, detailed documentation, and a dedicated account manager to help with any questions or issues you may have. Our priority is to ensure you succeed with our product, paving the way for your growth. 

00:06:23 Kailash Nath: That sounds promising, but would you be able to provide a live demo of the product? Seeing the configurations and dashboard in action would really help.

00:06:30 Rahul Kothari: Absolutely! I recommend scheduling a demo where we can walk through the full capabilities of Hypercheckout. We can tailor it to align with your specific payment requirements. How does next Tuesday sound for you?

00:06:50 Kailash Nath: Tuesday works for me. Let’s settle on a time—10 AM, perhaps?

00:06:54 Rahul Kothari: Perfect, I’ll send a calendar invite for you. Is there anyone else from your team who should join the demo?

00:07:02 Kailash Nath: Yes, I think our product manager would benefit from participating. I’ll loop them in.

00:07:05 Rahul Kothari: That sounds like a plan. I’ll prepare a customized session to ensure it addresses your current pain points during the demo. 

00:07:12 Kailash Nath: Great, looking forward to it. I appreciate your help today, Rahul.

00:07:15 Rahul Kothari: My pleasure, Kailash. Thank you for the chat, and I look forward to our meeting next week!

00:07:19 Kailash Nath: Yes, see you then!

00:07:20 Rahul Kothari: Bye, Kailash!

00:07:22 Kailash Nath: Goodbye!

00:07:24 [Call Ends]
