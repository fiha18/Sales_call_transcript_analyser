00:00:00 Rahul Kothari: Hi Kailash, thanks for taking the time today. Let's discuss how we can improve your payment solutions.

00:00:05 Kailash Nath: Hi Rahul, sure I’m excited to learn more about your offerings.

00:0:10 Rahul Kothari: Thank you for taking the time today, Kailash. I understand you're looking to enhance your checkout experience and reduce transaction failures, which is a great focus area for any e-commerce business.

00:0:25 Kailash Nath: Absolutely, Rahul. A smoother checkout process is pivotal for us. We're facing quite a few issues with our current system, especially with failed transactions. 

00:0:35 Rahul Kothari: That's understandable. Our HyperCheckout could be an excellent fit for your needs. It's a pre-built, customizable payment page UI that allows for effortless payment collection on your app or website. 

00:0:50 Kailash Nath: How simple is the integration process? We have an existing setup, and I want to ensure it doesn’t become a labor-intensive task to implement.

00:1:00 Rahul Kothari: Great question. HyperCheckout is designed for fast integration. We provide API references and SDKs that enable developers to integrate it with minimal effort. You'll find that our documentation is thorough, allowing your team to implement it without extensive development resources. 

00:1:25 Kailash Nath: That’s encouraging to hear. What about security? With payment processing, that's always a concern.

00:1:30 Rahul Kothari: Absolutely, and it's a primary focus for us. HyperCheckout uses industry-grade encryption compliant with PCI DSS standards, ensuring that sensitive payment data is handled securely. Additionally, we have built-in fraud detection mechanisms to protect against unauthorized transactions.

00:1:50 Kailash Nath: That's reassuring. Now, our clients use several payment methods. Can HyperCheckout support multiple options, like UPI, cards, net banking, and wallets?

00:2:00 Rahul Kothari: Yes, indeed. HyperCheckout supports a comprehensive range of payment methods including UPI, credit and debit cards, net banking, and various wallets. This variety ensures that you can offer your customers their preferred payment options, enhancing their checkout experience and reducing the likelihood of abandoned carts.

00:2:25 Kailash Nath: Speaking of customer experience, can you tell me more about how failures are managed through HyperCheckout? 

00:2:30 Rahul Kothari: Sure! HyperCheckout has robust error-handling protocols. In the event of a transaction failure, it provides immediate feedback to the customer and offers them options to retry or use an alternative payment method. This minimizes frustration and helps in retaining potential sales.

00:2:55 Kailash Nath: That's good to know. Now, how does this integrate with our existing back-end systems? We use a mix of custom-built solutions and third-party services.

00:3:05 Rahul Kothari: HyperCheckout integrates seamlessly with various back-end systems through RESTful APIs. If your existing setup utilizes webhooks, we can leverage those as well for real-time notifications on payment statuses. Our technical team is always available to assist with any specific integration needs for your existing frameworks.

00:3:30 Kailash Nath: That sounds comprehensive. Can you break down the pricing for HyperCheckout? I need to consider that alongside our current expenditure.

00:3:35 Rahul Kothari: Certainly. HyperCheckout is priced at 0.35% per transaction. Considering transaction volumes can fluctuate, our pricing model helps scale with your growth without hefty base fees. 

00:3:55 Kailash Nath: Understood, so it’s a consumption-based model. How does it compare with your Express Checkout SDK?

00:4:00 Rahul Kothari: The Express Checkout SDK is another excellent option, priced slightly lower at 0.30% per transaction. While HyperCheckout offers a ready-to-use UI, the Express Checkout SDK is ideal for businesses wanting greater flexibility to build a custom UI for payment processing. It still leverages our secure back-end but gives developers more control over the payment experience.

00:4:30 Kailash Nath: Sounds interesting, but I imagine building a custom UI comes with its own challenges. What’s your support structure for that?

00:4:35 Rahul Kothari: We provide substantial ongoing support for the Express Checkout SDK.

00:8:20 Rahul Kothari: We offer 24/7 technical support for our clients, ensuring that you have assistance whenever necessary. Additionally, we provide detailed monitoring tools and customizable alerts, so you can stay updated on transaction statuses and any potential issues. This level of proactive support can help reduce transaction failures effectively.

00:8:50 Kailash Nath: Sounds good! So, what are we looking at in terms of pricing?

00:9:00 Rahul Kothari: The pricing for our Express Checkout API is quite straightforward—it's just 0.25% per transaction. There are no hidden fees, and you have full transparency on your monthly costs. This model allows you to scale without worrying about rising fees as your transaction volume grows.

00:9:20 Kailash Nath: Okay, I like the transparency. But can you elaborate on how this would scale with our business as we grow?

00:9:30 Rahul Kothari: Absolutely! Since our pricing is transaction-based, as your e-commerce business grows and your transaction volume increases, your costs remain proportional. Plus, our API is designed to handle high volumes efficiently, with load balancing features that ensure reliability during peak times, like sales events or holidays.

00:10:00 Kailash Nath: That sounds good, but what if we need to implement specific business rules, like fraud detection or customer segmentation?

00:10:10 Rahul Kothari: Our API has built-in features that can accommodate business rules, including built-in fraud detection algorithms. You can also integrate third-party fraud management solutions if you have specific preferences. Additionally, our reporting tools allow you to analyze customer behavior and transactions, providing insight for customer segmentation.

00:10:40 Kailash Nath: That’s pretty powerful. However, what’s the average implementation timeline for a project like this?

00:10:50 Rahul Kothari: Generally, the implementation timeframe can vary depending on your IT resources, but most of our clients see integration completed in 2 to 4 weeks. This includes initial setup, customization, and testing. Our team can provide ongoing support throughout the process to ensure everything runs smoothly.

00:11:20 Kailash Nath: Got it. How do we handle testing before going live?

00:11:30 Rahul Kothari: We have a sandbox environment that allows your team to test the integration with no impact on live transactions. This environment mimics real-world scenarios and allows you to run various test cases to ensure everything works as expected before you go live.

00:11:50 Kailash Nath: That's really helpful. Testing is crucial for us to ensure a seamless launch! And what about ongoing updates? How will we stay current with new features?

Our team releases regular updates that enhance functionality, security, and address any feedback we receive from our partners. You'll be notified about new features, and comprehensive update notes will be provided, so you can easily assess what applies to your operations.

00:12:30 Kailash Nath: That’s good to hear. Can you share some success stories from companies similar to ours?

00:12:40 Rahul Kothari: Certainly! One of our e-commerce clients saw a 30% decrease in transaction failures after integrating our Express Checkout API. They also reported improved user satisfaction scores, as their checkout process went from an average of 6 steps to just 2. Another notable case is a platform that increased their conversion rate by 25% after optimizing their payment options with our API.

00:13:10 Kailash Nath: Those numbers are quite impressive! It definitely gives us confidence in moving forward.

00:13:50 Rahul Kothari: Perfect! I’ll make sure to prepare a tailored agenda that focuses on your unique business needs, covering implementation, integration, and best practices for optimal success. 

00:14:10 Kailash Nath: I'd appreciate that. Is there anything else I should consider before we conclude today’s discussion?

00:14:20 Rahul Kothari: Just to reiterate, our commitment to supporting you doesn’t end once the integration is done. We’ll be here for ongoing support, as well as to address any scaling needs you may encounter as your business grows. 

00:14:40 Kailash Nath: Thanks, Rahul. This has been informative and helpful. I’ll consult with my team about the next steps and definitely follow up regarding the workshop.

00:14:50 Rahul Kothari: Sounds great, Kailash! Looking forward to continuing our conversation. Let’s make that seamless checkout a reality for your customers. Talk soon! 

00:15:00 [End of Call]
00:10:10 Rahul Kothari: I appreciate you taking the time to discuss how we can enhance your checkout experience, Kailash. To kick things off, I’d love to dive into HyperCredit first. It’s our lender orchestration system designed to streamline loan processing for businesses like yours. 

00:10:20 Kailash Nath: Yes, I’m interested in how it integrates with our current setup. We’re struggling with transaction failures at checkout, and I want to know if HyperCredit can help mitigate that. 

00:10:30 Rahul Kothari: Absolutely! HyperCredit integrates seamlessly into your platform. It allows customers to access financing options directly at checkout, which can greatly reduce cart abandonment rates. Essentially, it orchestrates loans from multiple lenders in real-time, ensuring you offer competitive rates tailored to individual customers. 

00:10:50 Kailash Nath: Real-time is crucial for us. Can you elaborate on the security measures in place during this process? Our customers are very wary of sharing financial information online.

00:11:00 Rahul Kothari: That’s a valid concern, and we take it seriously. HyperCredit employs industry-leading security protocols, including end-to-end encryption for data transmission and tokenization of sensitive information. This ensures that crucial data isn’t exposed even if there’s a breach attempt. Additionally, we comply with PCI DSS standards, providing our clients peace of mind when integrating financial tools into their platforms.

00:11:30 Kailash Nath: That sounds reassuring. So, is there ongoing support and maintenance included with the integration?

00:11:35 Rahul Kothari: Yes, indeed! We offer 24/7 support as part of our service. Once integrated, our dedicated account managers can assist you with any operational issues, software updates, or enhancements based on user feedback. Plus, we have a robust knowledge base and community forums available for your development team. 

00:12:00 Kailash Nath: Great! Pricing is always a factor, though. Can you break down what the costs look like with HyperCredit?

00:12:05 Rahul Kothari: Of course! The pricing for HyperCredit is 0.40% per loan transaction. So, if a customer secures a financing option of $1,000, for example, our fee would be just $4. This lets you keep more of the revenue while providing financing options that might lead to higher average order values.

00:12:25 Kailash Nath: That’s reasonable. Now, can you clarify how you handle multiple payment methods both for HyperCredit and your other product, the Payment Forms?

00:12:35 Rahul Kothari: Sure! For HyperCredit, it supports multiple payment options including credit cards, debit cards, and digital wallets, which customers can select based on their preferred payment method. As for Payment Forms, it's an easy-to-use solution where customers can collect payments without the complexities of website integration. It supports varied payment methods too, giving you the flexibility to reach more customers without any heavy infrastructure.

00:13:05 Kailash Nath: Speaking of Payment Forms, can you explain how that fits into our existing framework? We're primarily an e-commerce platform.

00:13:10 Rahul Kothari: Certainly! Payment Forms is a lightweight solution that's perfect for merchants wanting to sell via social media, emails, or during events. You don’t need any complicated coding – after a quick setup, you can generate unique payment links, allowing you to accept payments instantly anywhere. For an e-commerce setup like yours, this could be a tremendous value-add to offer services outside of your traditional checkout flow.

00:13:35 Kailash Nath: I can see the potential there. However, would I need to adjust our existing systems to accommodate these forms?

00:13:40 Rahul Kothari: Not at all! The integration process is designed to be non-disruptive. You’ll receive simple API calls for handling transactions, which can work alongside your existing architecture with minimal changes. Our developer support team will be there to guide you through the entire setup process.

00:14:05 Kailash Nath: That definitely eases my mind. Just to clarify, what’s the cost for using Payment Forms?

00:14:10 Rahul Kothari: The fee for Payment Forms is set at 0.45% per transaction. Once again, it’s a fair rate considering there’s no need for extensive tech integration. The simplicity can lead to more sales opportunities in the long run, justifying the transaction fee. 

00:14:30 Kailash Nath: Understood. Additionally, what about potential scalability? If our operations expand, can these services accommodate increased transaction volumes without performance issues?

00:14:40 Rahul Kothari: Great question! Both HyperCredit and Payment Forms are built on scalable architecture. They’ve successfully managed large transaction volumes across various e-commerce platforms without lag. We leverage cloud computing to ensure performance is optimized and that peak transaction times can be handled seamlessly, keeping user experience smooth. 

00:15:05 Kailash Nath: That sounds like what we need. But are there any limitations on the number of transactions we can execute? 

00:15:10 Rahul Kothari: No limitations! You can process as many transactions as you need without incurring extra charges. Our system is designed to handle high loads effectively, so whether you're doing thousands or millions of transactions, we’ve got you covered.

00:15:30 Kailash Nath: Awesome! So, if I wanted to take the next steps, what’s the implementation timeline like?

00:15:35 Rahul Kothari: Typically, we aim for a rollout in about three to four weeks, depending on your current systems and the level of customization needed. We emphasize thorough testing before going live, ensuring everything operates smoothly without disrupting your existing services. 

00:15:55 Kailash Nath: This all sounds very promising. I just need to ensure that my team feels comfortable with the technical aspects.

00:16:00 Rahul Kothari: Absolutely! I can arrange a technical demo for your developers, where we can go through the APIs and integration process together. This way, they can ask questions directly and get a clear understanding of the implementation.

00:16:20 Kailash Nath: That would be helpful. Please send over the details so we can set that up. 

00:16:25 Rahul Kothari: Definitely! I’ll follow up with an email including a timeline and setup time for that demo. 

00:16:35 Kailash Nath: Looking forward to it. I want to ensure we’re taking the best steps forward.

00:16:40 Rahul Kothari: That’s exactly the right approach, Kailash. We’re here to support you in enhancing your checkout experience and reducing transaction failures effectively.

00:16:50 Kailash Nath: Thank you, Rahul! Let’s make this happen.
```
00:15:10 Rahul Kothari: Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today, Kailash. I understand that your e-commerce business is looking to enhance the checkout experience while minimizing transaction failures. Our solutions, particularly the NACH Mandates and the UPI TPAP SDK, could be instrumental in achieving those goals.

00:15:30 Kailash Nath: Yes, that's right. We've been facing issues with payment failures and feedback from customers regarding the checkout process. Can you elaborate on how the NACH Mandates work?

00:15:40 Rahul Kothari: Of course! NACH Mandates, through our LotusPay solution, allow for automated, recurring payments—perfect for subscriptions or EMIs. The key benefit is the 99% success rate for these transactions. You can integrate it easily using our REST APIs or a user-friendly dashboard, which allows you to initiate and manage mandates effectively.

00:15:58 Kailash Nath: That sounds promising. But how does this work with our existing infrastructure? 

00:16:05 Rahul Kothari: Great question! Our APIs are designed to be straightforward. You’ll receive comprehensive documentation during the onboarding process. Essentially, you’ll need to register your customers and set up the mandates through our API, which will handle the recurring payment process on behalf of your business. Given the architecture, it's scalable, meaning it can grow as your user base expands.

00:16:27 Kailash Nath: Scalability is definitely an important factor for us. What about security? With recurring payments, we’re dealing with sensitive information.

00:16:34 Rahul Kothari: Absolutely, data security is paramount. LotusPay employs AES 256-bit encryption and tokenization for sensitive data to ensure that financial information is secured end-to-end. Moreover, we comply with all necessary regulatory standards, including PCI DSS, to protect customer data during and after transactions.

00:16:58 Kailash Nath: That’s reassuring. Now, can you provide some insights on pricing? I want to understand the overall cost structure.

00:17:04 Rahul Kothari: Sure! For NACH Mandates, we charge a nominal fee of just 0.20% per recurring payment. Given the success rate we’ve achieved, the cost is quite competitive, especially considering the reduction in failed transactions and associated follow-up costs. 

00:17:22 Kailash Nath: I see how that could offset expenses in customer service. How does that compare with the UPI TPAP SDK pricing?

00:17:30 Rahul Kothari: Excellent point. The UPI TPAP SDK is priced at 0.30% per transaction and enables you to transform your application into a payment provider similar to GPay or PayTM. This offers both P2P and P2M capabilities, allowing for a seamless checkout experience. 

00:17:49 Kailash Nath: I like the sound of that. Can you explain how integrating the UPI TPAP SDK would look in practice?

00:17:56 Rahul Kothari: Certainly! Integration involves embedding our SDK into your app. Our comprehensive documentation and developer tools provide step-by-step processes to guide your technical team. Once integrated, users can initiate UPI transactions directly within your app, making the payment process frictionless without redirecting to third-party services.

00:18:18 Kailash Nath: That does sound seamless. Could you also throw some light on the ongoing support and maintenance following the integration?

00:18:25 Rahul Kothari: Of course. After the initial integration, our dedicated support team is available 24/7 to assist with any technical challenges or questions. We also provide regular updates and maintain the SDK to ensure compatibility with any changes from the UPI Infrastructure. This way, you can focus on your business operations without worrying about maintenance.

00:18:54 Kailash Nath: That’s good to hear. How do you ensure that any potential disruptions during updates are minimized?

00:19:01 Rahul Kothari: We take an agile approach with our updates. Before deployment, we conduct extensive testing in a sandbox environment, and we provide advance notice for any scheduled maintenance. Additionally, our SDK includes fallbacks to user-friendly error messages, ensuring that customer experience is maintained even during unforeseen downtimes.

00:19:27 Kailash Nath: Sounds like a robust plan. Could you share real-world examples of how other companies have benefited from these solutions?

00:19:34 Rahul Kothari: Absolutely! One of our clients, a subscription-based service, was experiencing a 15% payment failure rate. After integrating NACH Mandates, they reduced that rate to less than 2%, significantly increasing revenue and customer retention. For the UPI TPAP SDK, we have seen businesses increase their payment completion rates by 20% within just a few months post-implementation.

00:19:57 Kailash Nath: Impressive! So, if we were to move forward with both solutions, what would the onboarding timeline look like?

00:20:05 Rahul Kothari: Typically, we can kick off the onboarding process within a week of signing the agreement. The complete integration can take anywhere from two weeks to a month, depending on your existing infrastructure and resource availability. We will work closely with your development team to ensure everything flows smoothly, maintaining open communication throughout.

00:20:28 Kailash Nath: One last thing—what kind of reporting capabilities do you have to track the transaction success rates and customer engagement?

00:20:35 Rahul Kothari: Great question. Our dashboard provides real-time analytics, including transaction success rates, user patterns, and comprehensive reports on failed transactions. You can also set up alerts for unusual transaction activity, enabling proactive responses to any potential issues.

00:20:56 Kailash Nath: That sounds valuable. I appreciate all the information you’ve shared, Rahul. It gives me a clearer picture of how we can enhance our payment experience.

00:21:05 Rahul Kothari: I'm glad to hear that! It's important for us to tailor our solutions to your specific needs. If you have any further questions or require a demo, just let me know – I'm here to help.

00:21:22 Kailash Nath: I’ll deliberate on this and reach out soon. Thanks again for your time!

00:21:29 Rahul Kothari: You're welcome, Kailash. Looking forward to your feedback!
```
```plaintext
00:20:10 Rahul Kothari: So, before we dive into the details, can you share what specific challenges your team is facing with your current checkout experience?

00:20:15 Kailash Nath: Absolutely. We’ve been noticing a significant rate of transaction failures during peak times, especially with UPI payments. Our customers often drop off because the checkout process feels cumbersome.

00:20:27 Rahul Kothari: Understandable. With HyperUPI, we’ve designed it specifically to address these issues. It allows for 1-click UPI payments, which can significantly reduce the friction during checkout. How does your current setup handle UPI transactions?

00:20:41 Kailash Nath: Currently, we have a traditional UPI integration, which requires customers to navigate away from our app. That takes them through several steps, which can lead to confusion and, ultimately, abandoned carts.

00:20:54 Rahul Kothari: That’s a common scenario. With HyperUPI, when a customer clicks the pay button, they won’t leave your app. They’ll see a pre-built, customizable UI that makes payment seamless. This should enhance user experience and lower those abandonment rates.

00:21:13 Kailash Nath: That’s intriguing! Can you explain how the integration would work with our existing systems? 

00:21:19 Rahul Kothari: Certainly! Integration is quite straightforward with HyperUPI. Our SDK can be integrated into your app with a few lines of code. Once implemented, you’ll have access to comprehensive APIs that manage everything from payment processing to transaction queries without any intensive backend work. 

00:21:38 Kailash Nath: Sounds efficient. What kind of support do you provide during the integration phase?

00:21:43 Rahul Kothari: We provide extensive documentation, and our technical support team is available for integration assistance. Whether it’s via email, real-time chat, or even a scheduled call, we want to ensure that your team feels supported throughout the process.

00:22:00 Kailash Nath: That’s reassuring. But what about security? UPI transactions require robust security measures. How do you handle that?

00:22:09 Rahul Kothari: Great question! HyperUPI leverages multiple layers of security. Firstly, all transactions are encrypted using the latest TLS protocols. Additionally, we comply with PCI-DSS standards to ensure that any cardholder data is kept secure while transacting. We also implement fraud detection algorithms to monitor unusual activities in real-time.

00:22:34 Kailash Nath: That sounds solid. Can you elaborate on the pricing model? You mentioned something about a percentage per transaction?

00:22:41 Rahul Kothari: Yes, our pricing structure is 0.15% per transaction. This means you only pay when your customers successfully complete a transaction. It’s incredibly cost-effective, and there are no hidden fees for integration or maintenance, which is crucial for budget planning.

00:23:01 Kailash Nath: That makes sense. Do you offer any ongoing support or maintenance costs?

00:23:06 Rahul Kothari: The fee we discussed covers transaction processing and includes ongoing support. We’re committed to ensuring that HyperUPI runs smoothly, so if any issues arise, our team is ready to assist at no additional maintenance cost. 

00:23:26 Kailash Nath: That’s great to hear! What if we wanted to expand our payment options in the future—does HyperUPI allow for that?

00:23:34 Rahul Kothari: Definitely! HyperUPI is built to be scalable and flexible. As your business grows, you can easily integrate other payment methods or features. For example, if you decide to incorporate credit card payments or digital wallets eventually, our API enables you to do so without extensive rewrites.

00:23:57 Kailash Nath: Excellent! Another concern I have is around load handling. How does HyperUPI manage during peak traffic times, say during a sale?

00:24:06 Rahul Kothari: We use a distributed architecture that scales in real-time based on demand. Our cloud infrastructure is designed to handle traffic spikes seamlessly. That means during high-traffic events, such as sales or holiday seasons, the system can accommodate increased transactions without impacting performance.

00:24:29 Kailash Nath: That's a comfort to know. What reporting features do you provide? I need to keep track of transactions for reconciliation.

00:24:36 Rahul Kothari: HyperUPI offers robust reporting features through our dashboard. You’ll have access to detailed transaction logs, reconciliation reports, and analytics that can help you identify trends and issues quickly. You can also set up alerts for failed transactions, allowing your team to act rapidly.

00:25:05 Kailash Nath: Wow, that sounds really comprehensive! And how quickly can we expect to go live if we decide to move forward?

00:25:11 Rahul Kothari: Once we finalize the agreement, the integration can be implemented within a few weeks, depending on your team’s availability. We aim to ensure that everything is up and running smoothly in a timely manner, allowing you to see immediate benefits from HyperUPI.

00:25:31 Kailash Nath: That sounds good. Can you send over some case studies or testimonials from other e-commerce businesses that have seen success with HyperUPI?

00:25:41 Rahul Kothari: Absolutely! I can get those over to you shortly, along with a business proposal that outlines everything we discussed today, including implementation timelines and projected ROI based on your current transaction volumes.

00:26:01 Kailash Nath: Perfect! Thanks, Rahul. This has been a productive conversation. 

00:26:05 Rahul Kothari: I'm glad to hear that, Kailash. Do you have any other questions or topics you'd like to go over before we wrap up?

00:26:12 Kailash Nath: Just one last thing—how do you handle updates and upgrades to the HyperUPI system?

00:26:19 Rahul Kothari: Great question! We regularly update the HyperUPI platform to enhance features, security, and compliance with industry regulations. These updates are rolled out automatically without requiring downtime or significant changes on your end. You’ll receive notifications about upcoming updates and new features as well.

00:26:43 Kailash Nath: That's an excellent approach. I appreciate the clarity. I think I have everything I need to discuss this with my team.

00:26:50 Rahul Kothari: Wonderful! I’ll follow up with those materials and my contact info in case any additional questions arise. Looking forward to hearing from you soon!

00:25:10 Rahul Kothari: Thanks for discussing your current pain points today, Kailash. I understand that you're looking to improve your checkout process and minimize transaction failures. Our products, Juspay Payout and JusBiz, could significantly help with that. Let’s start with Juspay Payout, which streamlines large-scale payouts like refunds or vendor payments.

00:25:30 Kailash Nath: Sounds promising, Rahul. Can you share how Juspay Payout integrates with existing e-commerce platforms? Our tech team is particularly sensitive to integration complexities.

00:25:40 Rahul Kothari: Absolutely. Juspay Payout is designed for seamless integration. It offers RESTful APIs that our technical team can accommodate with minimal disruption. Essentially, once our integration is established, you’ll be able to send payments to any bank account, UPI ID, card, or wallet of your choice. We also provide SDKs and detailed documentation to ensure your developers won't face major hurdles during implementation.

00:26:05 Kailash Nath: That does sound ideal. Do you have any case studies demonstrating the efficiency gains or improved checkout success rates after using your service?

00:26:15 Rahul Kothari: Yes, we have worked with several e-commerce platforms where we documented a reduction in failed transactions by approximately 20%. One client in particular reported that our easy-to-use interface significantly decreased customer complaints about payment failures, ensuring smoother checkout experiences. We'd be happy to share detailed case studies post-call.

00:26:40 Kailash Nath: That’s impressive. How do you ensure that the payout process is secure? Data security is a major concern for us.

00:26:49 Rahul Kothari: Great question! Security is at the core of our offerings. Juspay Payout adheres to stringent PCI-DSS compliance standards, ensuring that all transactions are encrypted and secure. Additionally, we utilize multi-factor authentication and transaction monitoring systems to detect fraudulent activities in real-time. We also conduct regular security audits and encourage our partners to do the same.

00:27:15 Kailash Nath: Sounds robust. How does the pricing model work? I want to be careful about transaction costs, especially since we expect a high volume of payouts.

00:27:24 Rahul Kothari: Our pricing for Juspay Payout is straightforward at 0.25% per payout transaction. Plus, there are no hidden fees. For a high-volume business like yours, this model provides transparency and predictability in costs, making it easier for budgeting. If you’re processing a volume that meets specific thresholds, we can discuss customized pricing plans as well.

00:27:56 Kailash Nath: That gives us a good sense of the cost. How does this pricing compare to other solutions you've seen in the market?

00:28:05 Rahul Kothari: Compared to traditional payment gateways or banks, our pricing remains competitive. Many providers charge fixed fees along with percentage rates, which can significantly increase costs for high-volume transactions. Our percentage-based pricing model keeps it simple, and you only pay for what you use. It's designed for scalability without variable costs.

00:28:30 Kailash Nath: That’s definitely appealing. Speaking of scalability, how does your solution handle increasing transaction loads as our company grows?

00:28:39 Rahul Kothari: Our platform is built on a microservices architecture, which inherently allows it to scale effortlessly. As your transaction volume increases, our system auto-scales to accommodate the load without compromising performance. This means faster processing times and fewer headaches as you expand. Plus, we provide dedicated support to assist you during heavy traffic scenarios.

00:29:05 Kailash Nath: Impressive. How quickly can we expect onboarding and training? 

00:29:10 Rahul Kothari: Typically, the onboarding process can be completed in just a few weeks, depending on your internal resources and preparation. We provide comprehensive training for your team, both through interactive sessions and detailed documentation. Our dedicated support staff is always ready to assist you throughout the process.

00:29:30 Kailash Nath: That’s reassuring. Now, I'd like to know more about the JusBiz virtual card solution. How does it fit into the overall picture of improving our business transactions?

00:29:41 Rahul Kothari: JusBiz is ideal for securely managing payments to suppliers and vendors. With virtual cards, you can set limits for individual transactions, ensuring better control over funds. Each card can be generated for specific use cases, allowing for temporary or one-time transactions. This combination of security and flexibility leads to greater efficiency in managing operational expenditures.

00:30:05 Kailash Nath: And what about data security with JusBiz? 

00:30:10 Rahul Kothari: Similar to Juspay Payout, JusBiz follows strong security protocols, including tokenization of card details to prevent unauthorized access. Each virtual card is unique and can be deactivated after use, which makes it a low-risk solution for vendor payments. We also maintain comprehensive transaction logs that help with reconciliation and fraud detection.

00:30:35 Kailash Nath: Understood. What about the integration process for JusBiz? Does it involve much technical setup as well?

00:30:40 Rahul Kothari: The integration process is quite similar. It also utilizes our secure RESTful APIs and SDKs, allowing you to easily incorporate virtual card functionality into your existing systems. The goal is to offer you fast and straightforward integration that won’t disrupt your ongoing operations. 

00:31:05 Kailash Nath: Excellent. Can you provide a detailed pricing breakdown for usage of the JusBiz solution?

00:31:13 Rahul Kothari: Certainly! The pricing for JusBiz is 0.35% per transaction involving virtual cards. This straightforward model helps you forecast costs effectively. Our goal is to provide you with high-value solutions while ensuring you have full visibility into your outgoing transaction costs. 

00:31:35 Kailash Nath: That’s helpful. So, what would the next steps look like for us to explore these solutions further?

00:31:45 Rahul Kothari: I recommend scheduling a product demo tailored to your needs. This will give you and your tech team hands-on experience with the integration process, and we can demonstrate how both Juspay Payout and JusBiz work in sync. From there, we can set up a follow-up meeting to address any further questions or customize the solutions based on your requirements.

00:32:10 Kailash Nath: That sounds like a plan. Let’s set up that demo and I'll coordinate with our tech team to ensure they are available.

00:32:15 Rahul Kothari: Perfect! I’ll follow up with my availability and some proposed times for the demo. Thanks for the productive conversation today, Kailash! 

00:32:24 Kailash Nath: Thank you, Rahul. I appreciate your insights and look forward to the demo.
