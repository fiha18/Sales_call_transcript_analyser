00:00:00 Rahul Kothari (fintech.com): Hi Kailash, thanks for taking the time to chat today! How’s everything going on your end?

00:00:03 Kailash Nath (ecommerce.com): Hi Rahul, no problem at all. We're doing well, just navigating through some challenges with our checkout experience. It’s been a bit hectic.

00:00:10 Rahul Kothari: I completely understand. Many e-commerce businesses are facing similar issues lately. Specifically, what challenges are you encountering with your checkout process?

00:00:18 Kailash Nath: Well, we’ve noticed a significant drop in conversion rates at checkout. It seems users are abandoning their carts due to complicated payment flows and occasional transaction failures.

00:00:27 Rahul Kothari: That’s a common issue, but I believe Juspay Hypercheckout can help streamline that. Our solution is designed to offer a seamless payment experience across multiple platforms and improve transaction success rates. Have you had an opportunity to look into our features?

00:00:42 Kailash Nath: I’ve skimmed through the summary, but I’d love to hear more about its integration capabilities. We have a mix of technologies in-house, and I want to know how easily Juspay can fit into our existing architecture.

00:00:53 Rahul Kothari: Great question! Juspay Hypercheckout can be integrated with Android, iOS, and web platforms, including frameworks like Flutter and React Native. The integration process is quite developer-friendly—our SDK allows you to get up and running with minimal effort. The overhead for engineering is reduced significantly since we provide comprehensive APIs.

00:01:14 Kailash Nath: That sounds helpful. But how often do we need to update or maintain the integration? Ongoing costs can add up quickly.

00:01:21 Rahul Kothari: I completely hear your concerns. One of the fantastic features of Hypercheckout is the over-the-air updates. This means you can push configuration changes in real-time without needing to release a new app version. This reduces the maintenance burden and keeps your integration aligned with any new payment features or methods we may introduce. Would that alleviate some of your worries?

00:01:45 Kailash Nath: Definitely, that could save us time. Now, regarding security—what protocols does Juspay implement to ensure our users’ data is kept safe?

00:01:54 Rahul Kothari: Excellent question, Kailash. Security is paramount in payments. We ensure RBI compliance by using card-on-file tokenization. This means actual card details are not stored; instead, we store tokens, significantly reducing the risk of data breaches. Additionally, we implement mobile number-based OTP authentication for wallet transactions and EMI flows, providing an additional layer of security. 

00:02:21 Kailash Nath: That sounds robust. However, I need to ensure that our customers' personal data is safeguarded while keeping them comfortable with the payment process. 

00:02:28 Rahul Kothari: Absolutely, and we maintain that balance with our user journey designs as well. With features like app-invoke user journeys, we allow popular payment apps like GPay, PhonePe, and Paytm to be directly invoked from the checkout page, which enhances user familiarity and reduces abandonment due to frustration.

00:02:49 Kailash Nath: Hmm, interesting. I can see how that would help with conversions. What about the different payment methods? What can we offer to our users?

00:02:56 Rahul Kothari: Our solution supports a broad spectrum of payment flows. We have options for cards, net banking, UPI, EMI plans—including no-cost EMI—and different wallet integrations. Plus, we have strategies for 'Buy Now, Pay Later' systems with integrations for partners like Lazypay and Simpl. This flexibility can cater to a wide range of consumer preferences and improve your checkout rate significantly.

00:03:24 Kailash Nath: That’s a substantial variety. I’m curious about the costs associated with using your service. How do you price? 

00:03:30 Rahul Kothari: Sure! For startups like yours, we have a competitive pricing model. We typically charge a transaction fee of 0.35%. Alternatively, there's a flat subscription fee of ₹20,000 a month. If you're anticipating high volumes, we can offer a discounted option of 0.25% per transaction or ₹15K/month. Which option aligns better with your anticipated transaction volume?

00:03:58 Kailash Nath: I'll have to analyze our anticipated transaction volumes closely. The flexibility is definitely a plus. Are there any hidden costs we should be aware of?

00:04:06 Rahul Kothari: No hidden fees, I assure you! We believe in transparency. The only other associated cost might be any potential transaction fees from the payment providers you choose to work with on top of our fees. Everything is clearly outlined in our contract.

00:04:24 Kailash Nath: Alright! Would you mind elaborating more on the analytics features? We need to track payment success rates and understand where customers drop off in the process.

00:04:35 Rahul Kothari: Absolutely! Juspay provides extensive analytics across checkout, transactions, and refunds. This insight allows you to track user behavior, pinpoint problems in the payment process, and understand success rates across dimensions. Better analytics can help optimize your operations significantly—with a view into both high-performing and under-performing areas.

00:05:07 Kailash Nath: That would be very useful. My team has been looking for ways to improve operational efficiencies. What about refunds—how does that work within your system?

00:05:16 Rahul Kothari: Refunds are quite straightforward with Juspay. Our dashboard allows you to manage refunds efficiently, so you can process them directly without complicated workflows. Plus, our analytics will help you track and understand refund patterns over time, aiding your overall operational strategy.

00:05:38 Kailash Nath: Good to know! It sounds like a lot of features rolled into one solution. Before we conclude, can you provide a brief overview of how the solution optimizes costs further?

00:05:47 Rahul Kothari: Of course! With the capability to onboard multiple payment processors and manage them effectively, you can choose to route transactions based on the lowest processing costs while still ensuring maximal conversion rates. Plus, since integration costs and maintenance are minimized, you're freeing up resources to invest where it matters most. 

00:06:12 Kailash Nath: I like the sound of that. I’ll need to bring this back for discussion with my team. What are the next steps if we want to explore this further?

00:06:20 Rahul Kothari: Let’s set up a product demo where I can walk you through the platform and its capabilities in detail. I can also answer any technical questions you and your team might have. How does next week look for you?

00:06:33 Kailash Nath: Next week sounds good. I’ll check our schedules. Would it be possible to get some tailored material before the demo?

00:06:40 Rahul Kothari: Certainly! I’ll send over comprehensive documentation regarding the integration process, security features, and case studies from similar e-commerce businesses. This way, you can digest it before our meeting.

00:06:53 Kailash Nath: Perfect, I appreciate it, Rahul. Looking forward to diving deeper into this.

00:06:56 Rahul Kothari: Same here, Kailash! I’m excited to help solve your payment challenges. Let’s reconnect soon.

00:07:00 Kailash Nath: Will do. Thanks again for your time.

00:07:02 Rahul Kothari: No problem at all. Have a great day!
