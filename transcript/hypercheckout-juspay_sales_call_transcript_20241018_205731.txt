00:00:00 Rahul Kothari (Juspay): Hi Kailash, how are you today?

00:00:02 Kailash Nath (E-commerce): I'm doing well, Rahul! Thanks for asking. Excited to discuss our checkout experience and how we can enhance it further.

00:00:06 Rahul Kothari: Absolutely! I know you’ve mentioned that improving the checkout experience and reducing transaction failures are critical challenges for you. Let’s dive right in. 

00:00:12 Kailash Nath: Yes, we’ve seen quite a few drop-offs at the point of checkout. It’s impacting our conversion rates, which is something we need to address urgently.

00:00:18 Rahul Kothari: I understand. Juspay Hypercheckout is specifically designed to tackle these issues. It’s a cross-platform, adaptive payments orchestrator that integrates seamlessly with your existing apps and websites, ensuring minimal tech investment.

00:00:30 Kailash Nath: That sounds interesting. Can you tell me more about how the integration process works?

00:00:34 Rahul Kothari: Certainly! Integration is straightforward with our robust APIs. You can implement it across multiple platforms like Android, iOS, and Web, utilizing frameworks such as Flutter, React Native, and Cordova. We provide comprehensive documentation and support throughout the process.

00:00:50 Kailash Nath: Great to hear! But how do you ensure that the integration doesn’t overwhelm our existing systems?

00:00:55 Rahul Kothari: That's a valid concern. Our solution is designed to minimize disruptions. We use Over-the-Air updates, which allow for real-time configuration changes without needing frequent app updates. This way, your existing systems remain functional while we enhance your payment processes.

00:01:10 Kailash Nath: That’s a plus. Now, regarding security, how does Juspay handle sensitive transaction data?

00:01:15 Rahul Kothari: Security is paramount for us. We employ Card-on-File Tokenisation, which is RBI compliant, ensuring that sensitive information is not stored in your systems. Additionally, we use mobile number-based OTP authentication for wallets and EMI flows, adding another layer of security.

00:01:32 Kailash Nath: Sounds solid. But what about data privacy? How do you handle that?

00:01:36 Rahul Kothari: Great question! Data privacy is integrated into our core strategy. We adhere to strict data protection regulations and ensure that user data is encrypted during transmission and storage. You have full control over your data, and we provide tools for you to manage access and auditing.

00:01:56 Kailash Nath: That alleviates some of my concerns. Now, can you explain how Hypercheckout can actually improve our checkout experience?

00:02:02 Rahul Kothari: Of course! Hypercheckout offers a wide range of payment methods, including cards, UPI, wallets, and Buy Now Pay Later options. This diversity enhances user experience and caters to different customer preferences. Additionally, our App-invoke User Journeys simplify the payment process by allowing users to invoke payment apps directly from your checkout page.

00:02:28 Kailash Nath: Interesting. Simplifying the payment process is definitely a priority for us. How do your analytics work post-integration?

00:02:34 Rahul Kothari: Our analytics feature is robust and offers insights into checkout performance, transaction success rates, and user behavior. You’ll be able to track metrics like conversion rates and identify areas for improvement. This data is crucial for optimizing your payment flows.

00:02:55 Kailash Nath: That sounds useful. However, I’m concerned about the costs involved. Can you break down your pricing structure for me?

00:03:01 Rahul Kothari: Absolutely. For startups, we offer a transaction fee of 0.35% per transaction with a monthly subscription of ₹20,000. Alternatively, there’s a discounted option at 0.25% per transaction or ₹15,000 per month, whichever is higher. This flexibility allows you to choose a model that suits your transaction volume.

00:03:24 Kailash Nath: I see. That seems manageable, but I wonder how additional fees might crop up as we scale?

00:03:29 Rahul Kothari: That’s a valid point. The key here is that our pricing is transparent. You won’t face hidden fees for standard operations. As you scale, you might see a slight increase in transaction fees, but we also have options for volume-based pricing that can be beneficial as your transaction numbers grow.

00:03:50 Kailash Nath: That's reassuring. Now, regarding maintenance, what does that look like post-integration?

00:03:55 Rahul Kothari: We pride ourselves on providing ongoing support. Our team handles any necessary updates to the Hypercheckout platform, ensuring you always benefit from the latest features without additional costs or resource allocation on your end. You’ll also have access to our support team for any issues that may arise.

00:04:17 Kailash Nath: Sounds like a comprehensive package. I’m also curious about your performance optimizations. How does Hypercheckout deal with transaction failures?

00:04:23 Rahul Kothari: We utilize dynamic routing algorithms that monitor transaction success in real-time. If a payment fails, our system automatically reroutes the transaction to a different processor, significantly improving success rates. This minimizes the chances of failed transactions impacting your business.

00:04:41 Kailash Nath: Impressive! That could potentially make a big difference for us. What’s the next step if we decide to move forward?

00:04:46 Rahul Kothari: I’d recommend scheduling a product demo to walk you through the features in more detail and show you how it integrates with your specific systems. We can also address any additional questions you might have at that time.

00:05:01 Kailash Nath: A demo sounds good. Let’s set it up. I’d like to involve my team as well, so we can hash out the technical specifics together.

00:05:07 Rahul Kothari: Perfect! I’ll send you a calendar invite for the demo, and we can go from there. I’ll also prepare a tailored presentation focusing on your current challenges and how Hypercheckout can address them effectively.

00:05:20 Kailash Nath: Excellent! Looking forward to it.

00:05:22 Rahul Kothari: Likewise, Kailash! Thanks for your time today. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss how we can enhance your payment experience.

00:05:29 Kailash Nath: Thank you, Rahul! Talk soon.

00:05:31 Rahul Kothari: Talk soon! Bye.

00:05:33 Kailash Nath: Bye.
