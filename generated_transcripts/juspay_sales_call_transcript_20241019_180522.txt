0:08:27 Rohit Kothari: Of course! The pricing for the Express Checkout API is structured at 0.25% per transaction. This means you only pay when a transaction is successfully processed, which is beneficial for managing costs, especially for a growing e-commerce platform like yours. There are no setup or monthly fees, making it an affordable option as you scale.

0:08:51 Kailash Nath: I like the transaction-based model. Are there any hidden fees or additional costs we should be aware of?

0:08:58 Rohit Kothari: No hidden fees, I assure you. The 0.25% is the only fee you'll encounter for each transaction. However, depending on your payment processor, there may be fees associated with them. We can help you navigate those costs and find the best options for your business.

0:09:19 Kailash Nath: That sounds fair. I just want to make sure we don’t get caught off guard by unexpected charges. 

0:09:25 Rohit Kothari: Absolutely, and that’s a common concern. Transparency is key to our approach. We want to build a partnership where you feel confident in the costs associated with our services. If you need a detailed breakdown or have specific scenarios in mind, I’d be happy to work through those with you.

0:09:44 Kailash Nath: That would be helpful. I can see how your solution could fit well with our operations, but I still need to evaluate the technical compatibility with our current systems.

0:12:01 Rohit Kothari: Great question, Kailash. The 0.40% fee is the main transaction cost associated with HyperCredit. There are no hidden fees for maintenance or support. We include ongoing support as part of our service package, which means you can reach out to our team whenever you need assistance—whether it's for troubleshooting or general inquiries about the system. Our goal is to ensure that you have a smooth experience with our platform.

0:12:29 Kailash Nath: That's a relief. Now, regarding Payment Forms, could you explain how they integrate with our operations? We do a lot of pop-up events, and I need to ensure that our payment process is efficient.

0:12:39 Rohit Kothari: Payment Forms are an excellent fit for events like yours. They allow you to create customized payment pages without needing a full-fledged website. You simply generate a link for your payment form and share it with customers. The form itself is hosted on our secure servers, so you won’t have to worry about managing sensitive data. For integration, you can easily embed these forms into your existing communication channels—be it through email, social media, or QR codes at your events.

0:13:07 Kailash Nath: That does sound convenient, but how would that work in terms of customer experience? Will it feel seamless for them?

0:13:15 Rohit Kothari: Yes, absolutely! The Payment Forms are designed to provide a user-friendly experience. When customers click the link, they are taken to a responsive payment page that matches your branding—so it feels like an extension of your business. The checkout process is straightforward, requiring minimal clicks to complete a transaction, which helps reduce cart abandonment rates.

Our incident response team would conduct a thorough investigation to assess the scope and impact. We also have protocols for remedial actions, including system patches and enhancements to our security measures to prevent future incidents. Transparency is key for us, so we ensure that our clients are informed every step of the way.

0:16:41 Kailash Nath: That sounds comprehensive. Now, regarding the pricing, you mentioned 0.20% per recurring payment for NACH Mandates. Could you break down what costs we might incur during the integration phase?

0:16:58 Rohit Kothari: Certainly. The integration costs primarily revolve around your development resources and the time it takes to implement our APIs. While we don't charge for the actual integration, you may want to budget for developer hours, which can vary based on your team's familiarity with API integrations. Furthermore, ongoing transaction fees would apply once you start processing payments, but we can provide projections based on your expected transaction volumes.

0:17:30 Kailash Nath: That makes sense. So, if we were to use the UPI TPAP SDK, would the integration costs be similar or different?

0:17:38 Rohit Kothari: The integration costs for the UPI TPAP SDK would be similar in nature. It involves integrating the SDK into your existing application, which is a one-time development cost. However, the SDK simplifies the payment process for your users, which might lead to increased transaction volumes, potentially offsetting those initial costs. We can discuss potential ROI based on your customer base and transaction patterns if you’d like.

0:18:06 Kailash Nath: Yes, I’d be interested in hearing more about that. How does the SDK enhance the user experience in terms of payment processing?

0:18:15 Rohit Kothari: The UPI TPAP SDK allows you to provide a native payment experience within your app, which is a significant advantage.
