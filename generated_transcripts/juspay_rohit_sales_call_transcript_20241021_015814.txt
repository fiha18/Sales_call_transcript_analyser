00:00:05 Kailash (myntra.com): Hi Rohit, sure I’m excited to learn more about your offerings.

00:00:11 Rohit (juspay.in): Great! So, to start with, let’s dive into our HyperCheckout solution. It's designed to provide a seamless payment experience without burdening your developers with complex integrations. With support for multiple payment methods like UPI, cards, net banking, and wallets, it’s really versatile. The pricing is straightforward at 0.35% per transaction, which can significantly enhance your customer conversion rates, especially in the e-commerce space. 

00:00:36 Kailash (myntra.com): That sounds promising. I’m particularly interested in how this integrates with our existing systems. We have a pretty complex architecture in place. Can you elaborate on that?

00:00:48 Rohit (juspay.in): Absolutely! HyperCheckout is built to be developer-friendly. It uses RESTful APIs, which means your developers can easily plug it into your existing tech stack. They won’t need to overhaul your current systems. The integration involves embedding a few lines of code into your checkout process, and from there, it can be customized to match your branding. Plus, we provide extensive documentation and dedicated support during the onboarding phase.

00:01:17 Kailash (myntra.com): That’s reassuring to hear, but we do have specific security protocols to adhere to. How does HyperCheckout address security concerns, especially with sensitive customer data?

00:01:29 Rohit (juspay.in): Great question, Kailash. Security is a top priority for us. HyperCheckout is PCI DSS compliant, meaning we adhere to the highest standards for payment security. All sensitive data is encrypted both in transit and at rest. Additionally, we implement tokenization to ensure that actual card details are never stored on your servers. This minimizes the risk of data breaches.

00:01:58 Kailash (myntra.com): Those measures sound robust. However, what about the scalability? As we anticipate growth, we want to ensure that our payment solutions can handle a spike in transactions, especially during peak seasons.

00:02:09 Rohit (juspay.in): Absolutely, scalability is key. HyperCheckout is designed to scale effortlessly. We leverage cloud infrastructure, which allows us to handle thousands of transactions per second. So, whether you’re experiencing a surge during a sale or a holiday season, our system can dynamically adjust to meet the demand without compromising performance. 

00:02:35 Kailash (myntra.com): That’s good to know! I’m also curious about the Express Checkout SDK. Could you explain how that differs from HyperCheckout and when it might be more beneficial for us?

00:02:48 Rohit (juspay.in): Sure! The Express Checkout SDK is more suited for businesses that wish to create a highly customized checkout experience. With this SDK, your developers have the flexibility to design the UI from scratch while still utilizing our secure backend for payment processing. It’s perfect if you want to have full control over the user experience and branding. Priced at 0.30% per transaction, it provides a cost-effective option for businesses requiring a tailored solution.

00:03:17 Kailash (myntra.com): That makes sense. So, if we were to go with the SDK, how would the integration process compare to HyperCheckout? 

00:03:27 Rohit (juspay.in): The integration process for the Express Checkout SDK is slightly more involved. Your developers would need to implement the SDK, which requires more setup compared to the plug-and-play nature of HyperCheckout. However, we provide ample support, including code samples and a sandbox environment for testing, so they can familiarize themselves with the SDK before going live. 

00:03:54 Kailash (myntra.com): Got it. And what kind of service level agreement (SLA) do you offer with these products? 

00:04:02 Rohit (juspay.in): We typically offer a robust SLA that guarantees uptime of 99.9%, which is critical for e-commerce operations. Additionally, we commit to response times for support tickets based on their severity. For critical issues, our response time is under one hour, and we have a dedicated support team available 24/7 to ensure that any issues are resolved promptly.

00:04:28 Kailash (myntra.com): That’s very reassuring. What about ongoing support after the initial integration? Will we have access to a dedicated account manager or support team?

00:04:39 Rohit (juspay.in): Yes, you will! After the integration, we assign a dedicated account manager to your account. This person will be your go-to for any queries or concerns. Plus, we offer regular reviews to discuss performance metrics and any adjustments you might need as your business evolves. 

00:04:59 Kailash (myntra.com): That's very helpful, Rohit. I have a couple more questions about the technical aspects of the integration and the specific payment methods supported. Would that be alright?
