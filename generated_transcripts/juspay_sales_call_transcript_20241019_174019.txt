00:00:00 Rohit Kothari: Hi Kailash, thanks for taking the time today. Let's discuss how we can improve your payment solutions.

00:00:05 Kailash Nath: Hi Rohit, sure I’m excited to learn more about your offerings.

0:00:11 Rohit Kothari: So, Kailash, to dive right into it, HyperCheckout is really designed to streamline the payment process for e-commerce businesses like yours. It offers a pre-built, customizable payment page UI that allows you to collect payments effortlessly on your app or website. You can support multiple payment methods—UPI, cards, net banking, and wallets—all in one solution.

0:00:35 Kailash Nath: That sounds promising. Can you elaborate a bit on how easy it is to integrate HyperCheckout with my existing systems?

0:01:14 Rohit Kothari: You’re spot on about security, Kailash. HyperCheckout is built with stringent security protocols, including PCI DSS compliance, end-to-end encryption for sensitive data, and tokenization of card details. This means that actual card information is never stored on your servers, significantly reducing your liability.

0:01:39 Kailash Nath: That’s reassuring. Could you break down the pricing a little more for me? I see the transaction fee is 0.35%, but are there any hidden costs or ongoing support fees?

0:01:49 Rohit Kothari: Great question. Our pricing is actually quite transparent. The 0.35% is strictly the transaction fee, which covers everything from payment processing to fraud detection. We don’t charge any setup fees, and ongoing support is included at no extra cost. Our support team is available 24/7 to assist with any issues that may arise.

0:02:15 Kailash Nath: That’s pretty comprehensive. What about scalability? If my transaction volume increases, can HyperCheckout handle that without a hitch?

0:02:23 Rohit Kothari: Definitely. HyperCheckout is built on a robust infrastructure that can scale seamlessly with your business needs. Whether you’re experiencing seasonal spikes in traffic or rapid growth, our system can handle thousands of transactions per second without any degradation in performance. 

0:02:45 Kailash Nath: That’s good to know. Now, what if I wanted to customize the payment experience further? Would using your Express Checkout SDK give me more flexibility?

0:02:55 Rohit Kothari: Yes, exactly! The Express Checkout SDK is tailored for businesses that want to build a custom UI while still tapping into our secure backend. It allows for complete customization of the payment flow, giving you the flexibility to design an experience that aligns perfectly with your brand. And the pricing is slightly lower at 0.30% per transaction.

0:03:20 Kailash Nath: That’s interesting. Would I still benefit from the same security features with the SDK?

0:03:25 Rohit Kothari: Absolutely. The Express Checkout SDK carries over all the same security measures as HyperCheckout, including PCI DSS compliance and end-to-end encryption. You’ll have the same level of protection, ensuring that customer data remains secure.

0:03:45 Kailash Nath: Okay, that sounds solid. What kind of technical support will I have after implementation?

0:10:10 Kailash Nath: That’s good to hear. What about data security? We handle sensitive customer information, and I need to know how you protect that.

0:10:20 Rohit Kothari: Great question. We prioritize security with industry-standard protocols. HyperCredit utilizes AES-256 encryption for data at rest and TLS for data in transit. Additionally, we comply with PCI-DSS requirements, ensuring that all payment transactions are processed securely. 

0:10:44 Kailash Nath: That sounds robust. Still, how do you handle potential data breaches? It’s a concern I have.

0:10:52 Rohit Kothari: I completely understand your concern. In the unlikely event of a data breach, we have an incident response plan in place, which includes immediate notification to affected users and a comprehensive investigation. Our systems are monitored 24/7, and we conduct regular security audits to minimize risks.

0:11:14 Kailash Nath: That's reassuring. Now, can we talk about the pricing model? You mentioned 0.40% per loan transaction. Are there any hidden fees or ongoing maintenance costs?

0:11:26 Rohit Kothari: No hidden fees. The 0.40% is the only fee applied per transaction. There are optional premium support packages if you require faster response times or dedicated account management, but those are entirely up to you. 

0:11:47 Kailash Nath: Okay, that’s clear. And how does HyperCredit support scalability? As our business grows, I want to ensure that the solution can keep pace.

0:11:58 Rohit Kothari: HyperCredit is designed to scale effortlessly. It can handle increased transaction volumes without any degradation in performance. Plus, our cloud infrastructure allows for dynamic resource allocation based on demand, ensuring that you won’t face downtime during peak shopping periods.

0:12:19 Kailash Nath: That’s a crucial point. We often see spikes during promotions. Now, how does the Payment Forms product fit into our overall strategy, especially for events?

0:12:29 Rohit Kothari: Payment Forms is an excellent solution for that. It enables you to accept payments without a website, which is particularly useful for events, workshops, or even pop-up shops. You simply create a form and share the link. It’s lightweight and extremely user-friendly, with a pricing of 0.45% per transaction.

0:12:54 Kailash Nath: That sounds convenient, but does it integrate well with HyperCredit? I want the experience to be seamless for our customers.

0:13:04 Rohit Kothari: Definitely. Payment Forms can easily integrate with HyperCredit, allowing you to offer financing options directly on those forms. This means customers can choose to pay in full or finance their purchase right there, improving the overall customer experience.

0:13:25 Kailash Nath: I like the sound of that. Can you provide a case study or example of a client who successfully implemented both solutions? 

0:13:34 Rohit Kothari: Sure, we worked with a mid-sized e-commerce retailer who integrated both HyperCredit and Payment Forms. They reported a 30% increase in conversion rates and a significant reduction in cart abandonment. They utilized the Payment Forms for promotional events and offered financing at checkout, which catered to a wider audience.

0:13:59 Kailash Nath: That’s impressive! Can you send me the details of that case study? It would be helpful for our internal discussions.

0:15:48 Kailash Nath: That’s reassuring to hear. But, could you break down the pricing a bit more? I see it’s 0.20% per recurring payment, but are there any hidden fees or maintenance costs?

0:16:02 Rohit Kothari: The 0.20% is our only fee for the NACH Mandates service. There are no hidden fees, and maintenance costs are included as part of our service level agreement. We also provide ongoing support without additional charges, ensuring you have assistance whenever needed.

0:16:21 Kailash Nath: That’s good to know. Now, regarding the UPI TPAP SDK, how does it complement the NACH Mandates? Can we implement it alongside?

0:16:34 Rohit Kothari: Yes, definitely! The UPI TPAP SDK allows you to process both peer-to-peer and peer-to-merchant transactions within your application. By integrating both services, you can offer your customers a comprehensive payment suite, enabling them to choose between recurring payments through NACH or instant payments via UPI. 

0:16:59 Kailash Nath: I see the value in having multiple payment methods. But can you elaborate on how the SDK integration would work? 

0:17:09 Rohit Kothari: For the SDK, integration is quite straightforward. You would embed our SDK into your application, and it will allow you to handle UPI transactions natively. The SDK also provides features like transaction history and user verification, which can be leveraged to enhance user experience. 

0:17:28 Kailash Nath: That sounds efficient. Is there any support available if our developers run into issues during integration?

0:17:34 Rohit Kothari: Absolutely. We have a dedicated technical support team that can assist during the integration phase. We also provide regular training sessions and access to a developer community where you can share experiences and solutions.

0:17:52 Kailash Nath: That's really helpful. Now, regarding scalability, if we experience a sudden surge in transactions, how does your system handle it?

0:18:02 Rohit Kothari: Our infrastructure is built on a cloud-native architecture, which allows us to dynamically scale resources based on transaction volume. We also utilize load balancing to ensure that no single server becomes a bottleneck, providing seamless transaction processing even during peak times.

0:18:22 Kailash Nath: That's good to know. Scalability is a critical concern for us. I assume that this architecture also contributes to system reliability?

0:18:30 Rohit Kothari: Exactly. Our system is designed for high availability, with redundancy and failover mechanisms in place. We also conduct regular stress tests to ensure that our infrastructure can handle spikes in demand without compromising performance.

0:25:02 Kailash Nath: That's good to hear. What about data security? We handle a considerable volume of transactions, and any breach would be detrimental to our reputation.

0:25:12 Rohit Kothari: Absolutely, data security is one of our top priorities. We implement industry-standard security protocols, including end-to-end encryption, tokenization, and PCI DSS compliance. This ensures that sensitive transaction data is safeguarded throughout the entire payout process. 

0:25:30 Kailash Nath: That does sound reassuring. Can you break down the pricing structure for the Juspay Payout? You mentioned 0.25% per payout transaction, but are there any hidden fees or ongoing costs we should be aware of?

0:25:41 Rohit Kothari: No hidden fees—transparency is key for us. The 0.25% per transaction is the primary fee, and there are no additional charges for support or maintenance. However, depending on the method of transfer, there might be network charges from banks or payment gateways, which are standard in the industry. 

0:26:05 Kailash Nath: Understood. Moving on to the JusBiz virtual cards, how does that fit into our current payment processes? 

0:26:14 Rohit Kothari: The JusBiz virtual cards are designed for secure payments to suppliers and vendors. Unlike traditional payment methods, virtual cards generate unique card numbers for each transaction, which adds an extra layer of security.
