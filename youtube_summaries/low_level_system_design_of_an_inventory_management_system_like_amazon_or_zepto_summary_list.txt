# MindMap Summary: Low-Level Design of Inventory Management System

## Main Topic: Low-Level Design

### Subtopic 1: Product and Shelf Management
- **Product Types**:
  - **Shelf Types**: Defined by three categories: **Small**, **Medium**, and **Large**.
  - **Product Placement**:
    - A **small product** can occupy any shelf type.
    - A **medium product** can occupy medium and large shelves.
    - A **large product** can only occupy large shelves.

### Subtopic 2: Class Structure
- **Shelf Class**:
  - Attributes: 
    - `ID`: Unique identifier for each shelf.
    - `Type`: Defines the shelf capability (e.g., small, medium, large).
- **Unit Class**:
  - Attributes: 
    - `ID`: Identifier for the unit.
    - `Status`: The state of the unit (e.g., Inventory, In Transit, Delivered).
      - **State Enum**:
        - `Inventory`: Not sold.
        - `In Transit`: Being packaged/delivered.
        - `Delivered`: Ready for delivery.
  
### Subtopic 3: System Composition
- **System Class**:
  - Contains a list of `Products` and tracks shelf locations.
  - **Methods**:
    - `GetProduct(ID)`: Retrieves product by its ID.
    - `AddProduct(Product)`: Adds a product to the inventory.
    - `PlaceProduct()`: Assigns product to the first available shelf.
    - `GetStatus()`: Returns the status of all shelves.
    - `GetProductList()`: Returns a list of available products.
    
### Subtopic 4: Product Lifecycle and Workflow
- **Product Onboarding**:
  - Process for adding new products derived from incoming shipments.
  - Example: If 200 units of a new product arrive, the `PlaceUnit` function is invoked for each unit.
  
- **Order Processing**:
  - **Order Class**:
    - Manages `n` products in varying counts within a single order.
  - **Order Fulfillment Logic**:
    - Check product availability before fulfilling an order.
    - Ensure product locations have the correct status before picking (e.g., not in transit).
    - Lock mechanisms may be necessary to prevent concurrent order conflicts.
  
### Subtopic 5: Reporting Mechanism
- **Daily Reporting**:
  - Use a queue system to collect events and generate end-of-day reports reflecting all transactions and inventory statuses.
  
### Programming Example Context
- **Pseudocode Overview**:
java
class Shelf {
    String id;
    String type; // "small", "medium", "large"
}

class Unit {
    String id;
    String status; // Enum: Inventory, In-Transit, Delivered
}

class System {
    List<Product> products;
    List<Shelf> shelves;

    Product getProduct(String id) {...}
    void addProduct(Product product) {...}
    void placeUnit(Unit unit) {
        // Algorithm to find an appropriate shelf
    }
    List<String> getStatus() {...}
    List<Product> getProductList() {...}
}

// Order processing class
class Order {
    Map<Product, Integer> orderedProducts; // Map of product to count
}

### Subtopic 4: System Architecture
- **Singleton Design**: 
  - The inventory system is structured as a singleton to allow static access to methods without instantiating the system.
  
- **Concurrency Control**:
  - Locks applied to locations to prevent concurrent orders from affecting inventory status.
  - Ensure that user interactions with the inventory are handled sequentially to avoid conflicts.

### Subtopic 5: Class and Method Overview
- **Main Classes**:
  - **Product Class**: 
    - Attributes related to the products in inventory.
    - Methods for adding, removing, and updating product information.
  
  - **Unit Class**: 
    - Attributes: ID, Product ID, Location ID, Status.
    - Method for managing unit status and location during orders.

- **Pseudocode Example**:
java
class Product {
    String productID;
    String name;
    double price;

    void addProduct(Product product) {...}
    void removeProduct(String productID) {...}
}

class Unit {
    String unitID;
    String productID;
    String locationID;
    String status; // Enum: Inventory, InTransit, Delivered
}

class InventorySystem {
    List<Product> products;
    
    void placeUnit(Unit unit) {
        // Logic to find the first available location and place the unit
    }
    
    void removeUnit(String productID) {
        // Iterate over units and remove specified product ID 
    }
}

- **Algorithm Mechanics**:
  - **Place Unit Method**: Checks for free location and assigns an ID.
  - **Remove Unit Method**: Iterates through the locations to find and remove the unit.

### Subtopic 6: User Interaction and Front-End Design
- **UI Flow**: 
  - Example interaction mimicking an e-commerce platform (e.g., Amazon), where users add products to their cart and place orders.
- **System Response**: 
  - The system must handle changes in product status during the order execution and updating the UI accordingly.

### Conclusion
