# MindMap Summary: Low-Level Design Discussion (Comprehensive Overview)

## 1. Introduction to Low-Level Design (LLD)
   - Mock Interview Format
     - Led by Arun Goyal
     - Focus on coding over architecting
   - Application in Focus: Make My Trip
     - Booking app for buses and trains
     - Emphasis on end-to-end trip solutions

## 2. Audience Engagement
   - Utilization of Slido for Questions
     - Interactive question submissions
     - Upvote system for prioritizing questions

## 3. Key Questions Addressed
   - **Concurrency Issues**
     - Overbooking scenario with concurrent bookings
     - **Solutions:**
       - Lock mechanisms to prevent double bookings
       - Transaction management for simultaneous payments
   - **Reservations Handling**
     - Online vs. offline booking synchronization
     - Room availability data management for consistency

## 4. Design Patterns in Low-Level Design
   - **Importance of Design Patterns**
     - Structuring solutions for specific problems
     - Familiarity through practice with different systems
   - **Commonly Used Patterns**
     - **Singleton Pattern:**
       - Ensures a class has a single instance
       - Example Use Case: Car parking system
     - **Facade Pattern:**
       - Simplifies interactions with complex systems
   - **Learning Path**
     - Use Case to Class Diagram Flow
     - Apply design patterns in hands-on projects

## 5. Real-World Applications vs. Interview Context
   - Similarities: Emphasizing clean code and product requirements
   - Differences: Expectation for pseudocode and conciseness during interviews

## 6. Flight Booking System Example
   - **System Overview**
     - Fetch flights based on requests
     - Seat reservations, cancellations, admin functions
   - **Use Case Diagrams**
     - Identify Actors: Customers and Admins
     - Manage flight data with clear system capabilities

## 7. Class Diagram Development
   - **Class Structure**
     - **User Class:** Base class for Customer and Admin
     - **Customer Class:** Handles flight data fetching, booking, and cancellation
     - **Admin Class:** Adds or cancels flights
   - **System Class:**
     - Handles list of flights and interactions with booking functions

## 8. Concurrency Management
   - **Optimistic Locking:** Handle price increases and rebooking
   - **Challenges with Regional Data Consistency**
     - Central database for managing availability
   - **Handling Multiple Requests:**
     - Boolean returns for booking success or failure

## 9. Detailed Class Implementations
   - **Customer Class Functions:**
     - `fixSeat(flight, seat)`: Boolean for booking status
     - `cancelBooking(flight)`: Manages concurrency issues
   - **Admin Functionality:**
     - `addFlight(flightDetails)`: Adds flights to database
     - `cancelFlight(flightID)`: Cancels flight based on ID
   - **Seat Class Attributes:**
     - ID, type, booked status, customer reference

## 10. Enhancements and Future Directions
   - Continuous engagement and learning in LLD
   - Upcoming projects focused on structured system design
   - Encouragement for audience participation in future discussions

## 11. Summary and Key Takeaways
   - Emphasized importance of LLD in career progression
   - Leveraging design patterns leads to efficient coding practices
   - Integration of theory with practical application enhances understanding

This comprehensive MindMap encapsulates the essence of Low-Level Design discussions presented in the video. It covers vital topics such as design patterns, real-world applications, concurrency management, and detailed class implementations in the context of a flight booking system. It serves as a guidance framework for learners seeking to deepen their understanding of software design principles.
